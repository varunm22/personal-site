During this January, I spent 4 weeks interning at the startup Cognite alongside 2 other students from MIT and several students from Waterloo. During this time, we experienced fjords, cross-country skiing, northern lights, and more. This post will focus on summarizing our weekend travel and weekday exploration of Oslo (vs the last 3 posts which detail my thoughts on life, work, and travel collectively).

### 1/6/19
We took things slow our first weekend in as we adjusted to jetlag and got set up in our apartment. On Sunday, we walked through the Vigeland Sculptures in Frogner Park and took lots of fun pics with all the sculptures and the landscape. Overall, the sculptures and such felt a bit underwhelming, but the snowy landscape and unfortunately early sunset made for good pictures at least.

### 1/11/19
After work, a few interns congregated at our place for a short pregame before we headed to SYNG MER for our 6:45-8:45 booking. While the room was a bit cozy (cramped) for the 12 of us, the actual karaoke setup was awesome. Like the nicer places in NYC, SYNG MER had an electronic song selection and queue, but unlike anywhere else I’ve seen, they also had options to adjust the key and tempo of each song! The place also had a weird baby statue up front, which really played to absolutely nobody's sense of aesthetic.

### 1/12/19-1/13/19
For our first full weekend in Norway, we decided to visit Norway's famous fjords near the town of Bergen. We started our trip with a 7 hour trip from Oslo to Bergen on the Bergen Railway. We were specifically told to do this during daylight for the wonderful views, and they did not disappoint.


{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0018.jpg" caption="Mountains seen from the train window" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0019.jpg" caption="A stark, snowy landscape seen from the train window" >}}

Then we arrived in Bergen. Though it was dark and rainy, the city's cobblestone streets and colorful houses were charming in the glow of the streetlights. We quickly noticed that part of the city was built up onto a mountain, which was dotted with houselights and the lights of the Floibanen (the diagonal string of white lights in the picture below), a steeply inclined (26 degree incline) railway used as public transit to various points up the mountain. After dropping our things off at our Airbnb, we took the Floibanen up the mountain.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0023.jpg" caption="Bergen's city lights" >}}

Due to the steep incline, the train car itself was actually built shaped like a staircase to allow for people to sit on horizontal surfaces. Also due to the incline, once the train car started moving, its movement felt more like a rollercoaster than that of a normal train. I initially assumed that the Floibanen served primarily as a tourist attraction and as a means towards a view, though I quickly realized this was actually a vital form of public transportation which took people to homes located at various points along our way. 

{{< youtube dn1CHxUNvQ8 >}}

At the top, we took some cute pictures at a lookout before wandering around to kill the half hour we had until our trip back down. We came across a giant troll costume, and in the dense fog, it was legitimately scary. The presence of a playground and elementary school behind the statue certainly contributed. Interestingly, the use of flash generally made our pictures turn out worse because of how reflective the fog was.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0027.jpg" caption="Looking out over the city" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0028-0029.jpg" caption="Troll photographed without and with flash - both cursed" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0030.jpg" caption="A foggy and obviously haunted playground" >}}

Further along the path, we found a signpost pointing out trails and destinations. Most suspiciously, it had a sign which pointed to “THE LAKE” which appeared to be handwritten and was a different color than the others. We followed it into some of the darkest, foggiest, most ethereal woods I’ve ever seen.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0031.jpg" caption="A foreboding entrance - note the sign for \"THE LAKE\"" >}}

As we walked through infrequently illuminated trees, we came across cursed signs. The first said “PLEASE DON’T WAKE THE BABY DINOSAURS”. With the original troll statue being next to a playground, this playful sign felt slightly more sinister. It was impossible to decently photograph as it stood far from any lamp post and my camera's flash reflected off the dense fog. The second sign we came across was in Norwegian, and Magnus's use of Google Translate came up with a translation of roughly "Don’t sit here when all hope is gone". Needless to say, none of us sat.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0032_.jpg" caption="The two signs we came across - it was impossible to get a better picture of the first sign because it was too far from any of the streetlamps, and flash reflected off the fog as shown" >}}


Finally, we made it to “THE LAKE”. Far from any lamp post, this area was illuminated solely by a Gatsbyesque floating green light somewhere along the shore. Due to the fog, pictures with flash were once again useless, so I used long exposure to document the scene. Immediately after, we rushed back and onto the Floibanen just in time for the next trip down.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0032_5.jpg" caption="The lake without and with flash. This area was dark enough for even that first picture to require a 10 second shutter speed" >}}

After being traumatized by the most surreal and horror movie-esque experience of my thus short life, we walked back through some wholesome cobblestone streets on our way back home. We ended the night by watching Blink (a famously scary Doctor Who episode) and cooking some tortellini to take with us tomorrow.

Later in the week, we asked Lukas (one of the interns from Norway) what his translation of the bench sign was. While our interpretation was "Don't sit here when all hope is gone", his was the significantly sunnier "Don't sit inside when all hope is outside", which makes more sense, but in all fairness, we were terrified.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0033.jpg" caption="After surviving the troll forest" >}}

Today started with 1.5 hours back on the Bergen Railway ending at Voss. Here, we officially started our self-guided Norway in a Nutshell tour with a bus ride through a “U-shaped” valley with pristine winter landscapes, distant mountains, and wonderfully yellow and red houses. At some point, we passed through a long stone tunnel and emerged into a much more narrow, “V-shaped” valley lined with 4000 foot tall mountains. Our driver informed us that this site had achieved UNESCO World Heritage status, like many of the places we would visit today.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0034.jpg" caption="Red houses in the snowy hills" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0036.jpg" caption="A dark forest" >}}

The bus ride ended at Gudvangen, a 60 person town through which a million tourists pass every year. Thankfully, we came at the height of the off-season so the town was relatively empty. Our boat tour today would take us from Gudvangen to another town, Flam, through the Nærøyfjord branch of Sognefjord, one of Norway's best known fjords. Gudvangen was a gorgeous town, nestled in the mountains at the end of a fjord. The fjord water was bright green, crystal clear, and filled with red and orange starfish.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0039.jpg"  >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0042.jpg" caption="Facing out into the fjord" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0040.jpg" caption="Starfish in the blue-green fjord water" >}}

This ferry ride was breathtaking. The boat was at around 10% capacity, so we had no trouble finding unobstructed views. Our admiration of the fjords was interrupted only by occasional trips to the boat's heated interior to escape the harsh wind and cold, though even this area had essentially floor-to-ceiling windows.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0067.jpg" caption="FJORDS" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0065.jpg" caption="FJORD village" >}}

We ended the ferry in Flam. Our first stop was for large, hearty pastries from a local cafe including a brioche bun, a cinnamon bun, and a chocolate croissant. We continued on to the shops and had our first exposure to truly Norwegian knitwear, which I then believed to be out of my budget.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0048.jpg" caption="Arrival into Flam" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0052.jpg" caption="Truly Norwegian sweater found in Flam" >}}

Next, we took the Flam railway, one of the most famously picturesque railways in Europe. This track maintains about a 6 degree elevation angle through its 1 hour journey to Myrdal, another stop on the Oslo -> Bergen railway. The train, with its pleasantly old-fashioned interior, wove through the mountains around Flam and the fjord with a stop at a frozen waterfall for pictures.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0054-0055.jpg" caption="In the rustic Flam railway train" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0178.jpg" caption="Sitting outside the final trainstop" >}}

At Myrdal, we caught a train which took us to Bergen, then we flew back to Oslo and slept very soon after we got home.


### 1/19/19
While exploring Oslo, we had felt that there wasn't really too much to see and do in the city in the winter. Turns out, all the Norwegians are out skiing. Cross-country skiing is one of the most popular activities in Norway, with many of my coworkers starting to teach their kids by age 3. In an effort to culturally assimilate, we decided to spend our seond full weekend skiing in Tryvann. The night before our first day, we created a multi-step plan to help track our day’s progress. 

#### Step 1: Meet
We had a somewhat chaotic series of miscommunications which involved walking in circles and going between multiple train stations, but finally at around 11, we made it to our target platform all together. 

#### Step 2: Find the ski lodge (and Step 3: Successfully rent skis)
We accidentally got off the train one step too late, but after a slightly longer than planned walk with portions down the edge of skiing bunny hills, we finally found ski rental. We were soon on our way with a 2 day ski rental and walking towards the start point of several beginner trails.

#### Step 4: Find a target destination (and Step 5: Hopefully reach it?)
Our first destination lodge didn't seem to far away and was accessible via a “beginner-friendly” path, but without paying too much attention to our paper map, we quickly got lost. Thankfully, Tyler was somewhat experienced skiing and could focus on finding the way. I struggled considerably with the minorly sloped portions of our trail until realizing I needed to tie my boots much more tightly. Once we made it to the lodge, we stopped for cinnamon buns and a bathroom break. We then took the correct (and much easier) route back to our start point.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0085.jpg" caption="Tyler leading the way" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0086.jpg" caption="Break at the lodge" >}}

#### Step 6: Find our way back to where we started

After quickly finishing this route, we continued skiing in the same direction towards the train station Midstuen, from which we could take a short train ride home. While the path (initially) remained easy to ski, it certainly didn’t remain easy to follow. The path forked several times, and we eventually found ourselves on an extremely icy slope on which Julien fell and broke a ski pole. 

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0087.jpg" caption="On our way again!" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0088.jpg" caption="View from the hills" >}}

We found our way to a road and walked 30 minutes along slippery and steeply downhill paths in heavy boots to Midstuen. Part of this walk was down a famous sledding hill used in the Olympics in the 50s. Upon reaching Midstuen, we took a train back to ski rental so Julien could purchase a replacement pole.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0090.jpg" caption="Sunset along our final walk" >}}

#### Step 7: Make our way home
Tired, sore, and defeated, we silently enjoyed our long train ride back. Because we had rented the skis for 2 days, we had to grapple the skis and poles up the stairs to our respective apartments. We resolved to plan a better route for tomorrow.

### 1/20/19
After yesterday’s mishaps, we formulated a new multi-step plan. 

#### Step 1: Get out of bed
Despite soreness from yesterday's trials, we met at the train station by around 9:30, already improving on yesterday.

#### Step 2: Get to the start of the trail
We went to the last stop on the train (Frognerseteren) to our trail head, then followed a large group of skiers until we reached a collection of signs. Once pointed to our next stop Skjennungstua, stating it was 4.5 km away.

#### Step 3: Get to Skjennungstua
While we were more comfortable navigating than yesterday, we still stopped and asked fellow skiers for directions when the path would split. Once they worked past our butchered pronunciation of Skjennungstua, their responses were generally “Well... I guess you could go this way to Skjennungstua, and you can take that path”.

Following their instructions took us down several steep downhill slopes, many of which I fell on. After one of these falls, a couple experienced skiers on their way up the hill stopped, and we had this conversation:

Them: “Are you ok?”

Me: “Yeah, I tried this for the first time yesterday, and I don’t think I’ve improved that much since”

Them: “You just started? This is a very steep hill”

Me: “Yeah, I’ve realized that.”

Them: “Well, are you at least having fun?”

Me: “SOMETIMES”

I eventually made it down in one piece, and we enjoyed some more level skiing for a while. Then, we noticed signs stating we were a kilometer away, and this is when things got rough. The remaining portion of the trail grew steeper and steeper uphill almost continuously. While I wasn’t as inclined towards fall when going uphill compared to downhill, I fell once in a while due to sheer exhaustion. 

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0094.jpg" caption="Enjoying a relaxing break" >}}

Finally, we made it to the top to Skjennungstua, a mountain-top lodge with beautiful views. This lodge is particularly known for good fresh cakes and other desserts, a fact we took full advantage of. As we sat outside, sipping hot chocolate and nibbling first on bread with butter and brown cheese, then on cakes, we observed skiers arriving. We quickly realized that we had taken a deeply unpopular path, and that the correct and more popular path seemed navigable by small children.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0095.jpg" caption="Tyler looking down from the mountain" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0097.jpg" caption="Our delicious snack, which included a brown cheese sandwich, a fruit crumble, and hot chocolate" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0098.jpg" caption="The outside of the lodge" >}}

#### Step 4: Get to Ullevålseter
Given our start at the top of a mountain, the next 2.2 km section was quite quick, though frighteningly downhill at parts. Within half an hour, we had made it to Ullevålseter. After our lengthy break at Skjennungstua, we just stopped by the bathroom and moved on. 

#### Step 5: Get to Sognsvann
After seeing a sign indicating 6.5 km to Sognsvann, I was mentally prepared for the worst. However, this path was generally quite level; our greatest concern was trying to ski among the surprisingly dense crowds. My only fall here was when I swerved to avoid a small toddler. This caused a minor pileup with a Julien and a faster skier behind us.

Overall, we ended up making it to Sognsvann in just about an hour. Total, we had gone around 13 km and spent around 3.5 hours including the half hour break at Skjennungstua. Sognsvann itself referred to large frozen lake next to our destination train station. We walked across its surface to an island in the middle where a family was having a campfire. After exploring, we headed to the station.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0103.jpg" caption="Julien on the frozen lake" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0101.jpg" caption="Intricate ice crystals growing on the trees" >}}

#### Step 6: Maneuver the train transfer (and Step 7: Get off the train and Step 8: Return the skis and Step 9: Get home alive)
Our route back to ski rental was surprisingly long, taking 50 minutes across 2 train lines, but we didn't mind the rest. After returning our skis, we headed back home and met up with Magnus, Allison, and Lukas to watch Trollhunter, a Norwegian mocumentary about a guy who hunts trolls. This was especially entertaining in the context of our last weekend Bergen trip as the movie visited similar places and the trolls resembled the ones which had terrified us in the forest. 

### 1/23/19
After work today, we went home, changed into swimsuits, and headed to our booking at the Oslo Floating Sauna. The actual sauna was quite small and made from what appeared to be driftwood, but once we were sweating inside, it felt quite cozy. The 10 of us played games like “never have I ever” and “hot seat”, jumping into the icy fjord water outside as necessary to cool down or reset our scores whenever we were eliminated from the games. 

The two hours we had booked in the sauna was just about as much as we could endure, and we changed and headed home soon after.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0106.jpg" caption="Our sauna group" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0107.jpg" caption="The floating sauna" >}}

### 1/25/19
TODO: EDIT STARTING HERE!!!

After work, we stocked up on food for the trip and packed lots of warm layers. We took our 2 hour flight, picked up our rental car, and drove 40 minutes to our Airbnb cabin in the middle of the countryside. As we drove through snowy and harrowingly narrow seaside roads, our eyes were glued to the bright myriad of stars dotting the pitch black skies. We saw a faint, yellowish-grey cloud which seemed a bit too narrow, so I took a long exposure picture from the car window. The mild green glow arcing across the sky in the picture proved we had just seen our first Aurora Borealis (aka the northern lights)! Once we reached our cabin, we went to its dock overlooking the fjords and saw a much stronger aurora. 

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0111.jpg" caption="The Aurora Borealis" >}}

We drove further along the road until we found the first point where we could pull off the road and park. From here, we explored a very snowy hike up the mountain (until it got too snowy around 5 minutes in) and a path down the rocks to the edge of the water. We saw a few more mild auroras here, none as strong as the one by our cabin, but they looked nice with the stars given the lower light level. We came back to the cabin by around 2am and quickly fell asleep.

### 1/26/19
We woke up bright and early at around 8:15 and packed up our stuff for the day. Magnus and Allison left for an ice climbing tour at 9:30, so the other 4 of us walked around Storgata, Tromso’s primary shopping street. After getting some pastries from cafes, we found Tromso’s oldest sweater shop, and given our general sweater obsession, we had to go. They generally had the same nicer brands we had seen elsewhere, but I knew I wanted to buy a sweater at some point, it was REALLY cold in Tromso, and this place had a sale shelf. I found a beautiful sweater in just the colors I wanted from what seems to be the best company (Dale of Norway) and which fit me perfectly, so I bought it and checked off one more item from my Norway to-do list. 

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0113.jpg" caption="Colorful houses in a frozen town" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0115.jpg" caption="One of many snow sculptures in an open competition" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0117.jpg" caption="The low mid-day sun" >}}

After this, we walked the Bruvegen bridge from the island Tromso resides on to the mainland. This area didn’t have too many restaurants or stores, but it did have Tromso’s most famous building, the Arctic Cathedral. Pictures describe this much better than my words would. We went inside to enjoy the architecture further while recovering from the traumatizingly cold walk across the bridge.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0118.jpg" caption="The Arctic Cathedral" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0119-0120.jpg" caption="View inside vs at the front" >}}

We stopped by one of the few nearby restaurants before heading to the base of the Tromso cable car, also on this side of the water. This cable car took us straight up a mountain, giving us an amazing few of all of Tromso just as night brought a deep blue glow to the sky. At the top, we took a few pictures at the lookout before retreating from the wind to the restaurant/cafe. 

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0121.jpg" caption="Base of the cable car" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0124.jpg" caption="On our way up" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0125.jpg" caption="At the top" >}}

The building had another door leading out onto the snow atop the mountain, so we went out to explore, following a sign which appeared to be a trailhead. After getting a couple hundred feet out, we reached deeper snow which went well above the tops of our boots and realized the continuing tracks were from snowshoes. Given our lack of equipment and generally frozen faces, we were happy to head back and share waffles in the cafe. After a bit, we headed back down and walked back across the bridge to our pickup for our reindeer sledding tour (for me, Anna, and Yue). 

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0126.jpg" caption="The barren mountain-top landscape" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0127.jpg" caption="The most progress we could make" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0128.jpg" caption="On our way down, with the last of twilight's glow gone" >}}

The reindeer tour started after a half hour drive to a Sami camp. The Sami people are a more indigenous group which has inhabited Scandinavia for tens of thousands of years and which are heavily involved with reindeer herding. We started by each taking a bucket of food pellets and feeding a herd of reindeer. I was quite surprised by how docile and friendly they were, though I guess it was relatively similar to many petting zoo animals, The only frightening part of this experience was making sure the reindeer antlers didn’t poke your face while they pushed their way towards your food bucket. 

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0132.jpg" caption="Anna feeding the reindeer" >}}

After the feeding. we were led to our sleigh to sit down. Once our reindeer were set in place, the remainder of the herd suddenly stampeded away from the feeding area into the rest of their territory. We started on our sleigh ride. The ride itself was pretty slow and mildly underwhelming, but sitting on a sleigh while looking up at the stars was extremely calming. The reindeer and sleds were arranged so it went reindeer-sled-reindeer-sled-reindeer-sled, and the reindeer pulling the sled behind you was walking right next to you. This was pretty cool since i could just look over and see the reindeer walking around two feet to my right. 

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0135.jpg" caption="Playing out my dream of being Santa in a reindeer-pulled sleigh" >}}

After the reindeer ride, we ate dinner inside one of the Sami huts around a giant campfire. After this, we gathered in a smaller Sami hut and the Sami man who owned the herd told us about Sami culture and passed around various clothing and everyday items they used. During this, whenever there was an aurora, they’d call us out to watch. At one point, we saw by far the brightest aurora I had seen yet. I took several long exposure pictures which turned out beautiful, and multiple people on the tour had me send the pictures to them. 

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/northern-lights.gif" caption="Aurora + reindeer" >}}

We headed back relaxed, but very cold and tired, and met up again with Allison, Magnus, and Vlad. We then headed back to get to sleep. 

misc thoughts:
- my feet were absolutely frozen during the reindeer experience, so next time I go somewhere this cold, I should invest in proper wool socks
    - I put my feet close to the fire while we were warming up between auroras
    - one of the guides told us that a really good aurora started, so I started to put my shoes back on and realized the outer of my two polyester sock layers had actually melted away across a 2 inch patch. If I hadn’t had the other layer, there would be melted polyester stuck to my foot
- despite our great aurora today being an absolute beauty to experience in person, it was definitely less bright looking than the ones you see in pictures
    - basically every northern lights pic you see is a long exposure, which helps a lot
    - still worth seeing in person, but definitely have to temper expectations

### 1/27/19
We woke up at around 8 to get everything packed up from our Airbnb. On our way to the city, we first saw a reindeer just wander across the road into someone's yard. A little further down the road, we saw an otter jump out of the water and run across the road, holding some unidentified prey animal in its mouth. Our cabin's remote location certainly helped with viewing wildlife, as the listing had advertised.

We parked the car and headed to our pickup for our next tour: dog-sledding. We started off with an hour long bus ride towards the mainland to an area called Ramfjordbotn. Today was already significantly colder than yesterday (it was around 3F), and the temperatures tended to be around 10F colder further inland and away from the city. Accordingly, the people running the tour got us set up with nice boots, mittens, and full-body snowsuits.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0143.jpg" caption="Fully suited up" >}}

After getting fully dressed, we went out to the sleds and huskies and played with them while the guides got everything ready. Allison and I paired up, and I took the first turn driving. The sled had room for one person to sit on the wooden slats in front while the other stood on the back rails, pressing a foot break or using a foot to push forward as needed for downhill and uphill areas respectively.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0142.jpg" caption="Dogs waiting to go!" >}}

Early on in the run, our dogs were crazy. The front two would frequently look back at us, and the back ones liked to dive through the taller snow on the side of the trail. All of them were particularly good at pooping while running except for one which seemed to be suffering diarrhea. Our dogs were super loud and super fast, so we frequently had to stop to avoid running into the sled in front of us. Eventually, our dogs tired out and reached more of a normal pace, but they were still super loud and excited and silly.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0149.jpg" caption="From our point of view" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0150.jpg" caption="Action shot" >}}

Throughout the sled ride, we travelled through some of the most beautiful and strange landscapes I had ever seen. We alternated between dense, but leafless forests and vast snowy expanses. Surrounding us on all sides were gigantic, jagged mountains. The mountains, as with the rest of the landscape, were a pure untouched white, with their peaks tinged orange by the reflected sunlight. We never quite saw the sun itself, but as it sat beneath the mountain horizon, it lit the sky in a blue glow which contrasted perfectly with the orange mountain tops.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0146.jpg" caption="Surrounded by barely lit up mountains" >}}

We reached a beautiful lookout point and stopped to take pictures and give the dogs a break. At this point, we spent plenty more time playing with our dogs and giving them belly rubs before switching drivers and continuing. By the end of our 2 hours of dogsledding, my minimal facial hair was frosted with ice, and I couldn't feel my face, fingers, or toes. We headed inside to change, thaw, and eat.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0147.jpg" caption="Yue with her favorite husky" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0151.jpg" caption="Me with my favorite sweater" >}}

After arriving back at the city center, we were exhausted enough from the cold ride this morning that we just picked somewhere to eat relaxedly before heading early to the airport. On our way to the surprisingly good and cheap Thai restaurant we found, we stopped in a small art gallery to see what styles of art a Tromso life inspires. Things didn't seem too strange as far as local art galleries go, but paintings of green summer landscapes definitely made me want to come back and experience the stark difference myself.

After our one hour delayed flight, we had 20 minutes to kill while waiting for the train back to the city. This quickly devolved into chasing each other with snap bracelets, two of which we got from the car rental counter and once of which we found on the ground in Tromso. 

misc thoughts:
- coming into norway, I had 4 items on my checklist: fjords, skiing, northern lights, and obtaining sweater
- as of this point, i’ve confidently achieved all of them
- the only additional thing i’d really want to get out of this trip is to visit some museums to have more understanding of norwegian history, but i’ve hit the big things at least
