This January, I went to London for 2 weeks to work from Jane Street's London office. I also took the opportunity to visit Neha in Milan on the weekend, as she was there for an MIT teaching program.

### 01/04/2020-01/10/2020 (first week in london)

I landed in London on Saturday, January 4th morning, dropped my things off at the hotel, and met up with a couple of coworkers who arrived at the same time. We wandered until we found something which happened to be open for brunch then went to walk along the river in a loop with London Bridge and Tower Bridge. Our hotel was right next to the Tower of London, which made this convenient.

We continued walking around this area in search of groceries and enjoyed the varied architecture of the city.

The next day, we signed up for a mobile scavenger hunt in the Natural History Museum. This took us on a 2-3 hour route of the building, which was about all we could manage with our residual jet lag, so we went back to relax after this.

Monday was the first day of work in the new office! The first morning was quite harrowing with getting setup on my temporary desk and being told I'd be giving a talk on my work that Thursday. My nerves were somewhat settled through fun conversations with my London coworkers.

Tuesday after work, I went with some coworkers to a classic English pub called the Prospect of Whitby, which has been in operation since 1520 (that's 500 years)! Here, we enjoyed heavy beers and an English pot pie. On my walk back to the hotel, I saw a fox!

Like the New York office, the London office provides a wonderful selection of food, snacks, and dessert. On Wednesday, the dessert was a tasty bread pudding with some sort of custard.

After work, I decided to check out some of the nearby clothing stores for a British wool sweater. While [my custom chunky sweater][1] would be arriving in a few weeks, I was still interested in looking out for nice wool sweaters here after my finds in Norway and Peru. One of the stores had some nice pics, but everything was expensive enough that I chose to hold off.

To celebrate my visit to London, my London coworkers scheduled a fancy team dinner for the 6 of us at Michelin starred Pollen Street Social. Unfortunately when we arrived, the restaurant was unexpectedly closed for the day. While they had attempted to call the coworker who had made the reservation, he tended not to answer calls from unknown numbers. 

Luckily, the same chef had started a second restaurant called Social Eating House, also Michelin starred, which happened to be walking distance away. Given our situation, they agreed to seat us, and we sat bar style overlooking the kitchen as they prepared our dishes. Most of us opted for the wine pairing, which involved having a sommelier explain how different wines worked well with each dish. I was entertained but usually lost.

The meal consisted of many courses, each of which is shown below.

### 01/10/2020-01/12/2020 (milan weekend)

I left work Friday just after lunch to catch my flight to Milan. I went straight to the hotel where I met up with Neha. At this point, it was late so we got pizza near the Duomo and walked around that area for some time.

The next day, we took an early train to Verona, the city of Romeo and Juliet! Milan, compared to more popular Italian tourism destinations like Rome, Florence, or Venice, feels a bit more industrialized like a modern large city. As a result, going to Verona was a nice way to get away to a small walkable town with charming architecture and cobblestone streets. Our first stop was to the Verona Arena, an ancient Roman amphitheater. While performances still happen here, there was nothing that day, so we just looked around the outside.

{{< figure src="/imgs/milan/0003.jpg" caption="The ancient Arena with a modern sculpture">}}

Going from the Arena into town took us through a huge selection of shopping streets, and here, we enjoyed browsing through all that Milanese fashion had to offer. Neither Neha and I were planning on buying anything from the incredibly luxurious Gucci and Prada stores, so we continued on to Casa di Giulietta aka the House of Juliet. This house claims to be the inspiration for Juliet's house from Romeo and Juliet. Though the house itself doesn't have a ton of historical significance (being the inspiration of just a fictional character's abode), we enjoyed standing on Juliet's balcony and seeing the classical architecture.

{{< figure src="/imgs/milan/0005.jpg" caption="Looking out from Juliet's balcony">}}

We continued to wander around various streets of Verona and into various shops. One perfume shop sold their wares in incredible hand-blown glass containers. After smelling dozens, we asked for the price of their smallest bottle and were told it was "only 90 euros"! 

{{< figure src="/imgs/milan/0006.jpg" >}}

I read some blogs about the best food to try in Verona, and [the one we decided to follow][1] took us away from the touristy restaurants and into the side streets to Hostaria La Vecchia Fontanina. We ordered classic Verona-style risotto (deep red and drowned in Verona-style Amarone wine) and local bigoli noodles with a nettle sauce which tasted surprisingly like Indian saag. These were served by a very charismatic water (who might have also been a chef?) who chatted with us about our plans for the day. When it came time to pay, he stated the bill as 40 euros, which seemed high to us. When we said this, he quickly responded with "oh actually it's just 30 euros and I have a surprise for you, so don't leave yet". We paid and waited for 10 minutes, but he mostly seemed to be talking to other tables so we eventually just left.

A few months back, Abhijit had mentioned that during his time in Northern Italy, he found that squat toilets were actually quite common there outside tourist areas. Based on my past tourist experience in admittedly very touristy parts of Italy, I did not believe him. At this restaurant, in the smaller city of Verona, away from the touristy square, there was a squat toilet! After I used it, I excitedly shared the news with Neha, but much to her relief, the womens' restroom had a traditional toilet.

Roughly following a list of Verona's highlights, we wandered past churches and towers and across bridges. At some point, we came to a public garden which seemed to have a small entrance fee but no one take payment, so we walked right in! There were plenty of beautiful hedges and fountains, one of which was frozen and had hibernating turtles under the ice.

Tired from the day's sites, we stopped next at a riverside path between two bridges and just enjoyed the sunlight. We half napped here until the sun went down and the air grew chilly. On our way back to the center of town, we stopped for dessert at a pastry shop then for dinner at a restaurant serving polenta - the final Verona signature dish we had not yet had here. Then we headed back to catch our train and retreated to the hotel.

The next day's itinerary included sights of modern and ancient Milan as chosen by Neha intermingled with a variety of culinary experiences chosen by myself. Our first sights - the modern side - included the Green Towers (apartment buildings with huge planted terraces) and some modern squares/shopping centers recommended by Neha's host family.

For the afternoon, while we had seen the Duomo from outside on our first night, we decided it was time to do it properly. We did a round of the inside then climbed many stairs to get to the top. The architecture of the Duomo was amazing (in classic large-Italian-church style), and we enjoyed the beautiful views of the city. After coming down, we went to explore Sforzesco castle, though by this point, our capacity for historical sites had been pretty saturated so we left quickly to get food.

One of our day's food stops was Manuelina, where we enjoyed Recco style focaccia, which is thin, crispy, and layered with cheese. This particular place had been visited by Einstein! Later, we stopped by Grom for gelato. While Grom is not local (it even has a location in NYC), it is some of the reliably best gelato in Italy and is still much cheaper than the showy touristy places. Dinner was at De Santis Panini Milano, a sandwich shop which served hundreds of different panini varieties!

We had decided at the start of the trip to celebrate Milan's reputation as Italy's fashion capital by making sure to buy something while we were here, especially since shopping with each other is always fun. Throughout the weekend, we had browsed many stores for, in particular, fun wool sweaters (my favorite clothing item! see [the sweater][1]). At this point, our favorite store we had been in was United Colors of Benetton (which happened to be the first store we stepped into the first day), so we made one last stop here on the way to the hotel where I found a really cool turtleneck with buttons on the side of the neck and in a strangely colorful shade of grey. Neha opted for a golden colored cardigan!

Finally, we had to head back to the hotel to grab our things. We went to the central station where Neha would catch her train back to her host family town and where I hoped to catch an airport shuttle. This involved being sold a ticket to the wrong airport, then being sold a ticket for the right airport but for a bus leaving in an hour. Finally I found a shuttle leaving in 20 minutes, and even after buying this third ticket, I still had spent less money than I had on the cab from the airport. I said goodbye and headed back to London. 

### 01/13/2020-01/19/2020 (second week in london)

I needed Monday to recover from the weekend, but after work on Tuesday, I decided to explore. Based on recommendations from my coworkers, I walked around 30 minutes to Shoreditch after work. It was cold, rainy, and pretty dark, but this area still felt more lively than the financial district area where I was working and staying. I came to a street with several thrift stores. After flitting in and out of 4 stores, I found a huge, gorgeous, purple, 100% wool sweater for just $13, so I had to get it. When I got back, I decided to try shrinking the sweater a bit to make it fit, and while I was able to make the width right, the sweater ended up a bit too short. Later when I was back in NYC, I tried shaping it again and was able to fix the proportions, but it's still a little funky in an endearing way.

{{< figure src="/imgs/london/0020.jpg" caption="The sweater pre and post shrink">}}

On Wednesday, I met up with a friend from college who happened to be in London and we, along with one of my coworkers and one of her friends went to a pub then to eat dinner at trendy vegetarian restaurant Mildreds Soho, which was really good! After dinner, we went for dessert at Chin Chin a trendy London dessert spot Neha had recommended based on a Facebook video she'd seen. Their hot chocolate is known for being topped with a huge, vegan marshmallow which is blow-torched before serving. As I dug my spoon in, hot chocolate spurt out of the other side and onto my shorts. After this poor start, the rest of the hot chocolate was pretty good, but still didn't feel up to the standard of all the amazing trendy dessert I've been spoiled with in New York.

{{< figure src="/imgs/london/0021.jpg">}}

After finishing up the work week (including another good company dinner on Thursday), I went to visit Radha, a college friend doing a masters at Cambridge. I caught a train Saturday morning, and after she picked me up at the station, we stopped for brunch and chatted about her experience there. After wards, we stopped by her favorite vintage shop and I found an amazing hand-knit wool sweater from the 80s that fit me perfectly, but I decided to wait a bit since we'd be meeting her friends just down the street for pastries. 

{{< figure src="/imgs/london/0026.jpg" caption="The beautiful sweater">}}

At the pastry shop, we shared several wonderful cakes with a pot of fresh brewed Earl Grey tea. Afterwards, the 4 of us went back to the vintage store, and after I got everyone's approval, I went ahead and got the sweater. The three of them mentioned they actually bought nice clothing here often, so we browsed the eccentric collection for a while before continuing on to tour the touristy and everyday parts of campus.

When I headed back to London, I decided to stop for dinner at Dishoom based on Neha's VERY enthusiastic recommendation. I tend not to eat Indian food out too often, but London's Indian food scene is much nicer than even NYC. When I arrived at Dishoom, I was greeted with a 90 minute wait, but without any other plans, I stuck it through. Through the mostly outdoors wait, I braved the cold by virtue of my new sweater, glasses of port the restaurant staff brought out, and Neha's repeated insistence that the food was worth it. 

Finally, I made it in, though this still meant a short wait in their bar/basement before I could get a table. Here, I ordered their "dharu wala" recommended cocktail, which was a delicious blend of something fruity with a variety of Indian and East Asian spices. I had hardly started the drink when they brought me to sit at the upstairs bar for my food. I skipped my standard Indian restaurant order of "something with paneer" in lieu of some of the starred recommendations: Pav Bhaji and Daal Tadka. Both of these dishes are things I think of as comfort food (best had at home), so I was shocked the the depth of flavor they had. I left very satisfied and confident that this is the best Indian restaurant food I've ever had.

{{< figure src="/imgs/london/0024.jpg" caption="The drink came with this description: The China trade turned opium, spice, and silk into merchant fortune, and dressed fortunate merchant wives in best Tanchoi silk.

The next morning, I took an early flight out and arrived back in NYC by afternoon.
