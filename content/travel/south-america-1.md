### 7/2: Arrival in Quito

Keshav and I started off with an 11:45am flight from Minnesota through Miami to Quito. Upon arrival, customs was relatively quick and painless, and we were directed to a desk which would call us a cab to our hostel. I expected to run into some not-so-English-friendly situations eventually during this trip, but not this quickly. During the cab ride, our driver realized he didn‚Äôt quite know where he was going, so Keshav had to pull up navigation on his own phone and provide verbal instructions in Spanish.

Upon reaching the hostel, I realized the front desk worker also spoke zero English, so once again, I relied a lot on my brother‚Äôs Spanish abilities to get us checked in. Our room at Hostal Oro Orense was quite small with just 1 full-size bed, but we at least had a private bathroom.

Our cab driver had mentioned to us that Quito itself is at 3000m elevation, which could have explained the mild headache I was starting to feel. We showered, figured out tomorrow‚Äôs route, and quickly headed to bed.

### 7/3: Heading to Quilotoa

Through a combination of a cold room, high altitude, and frequent bathroom trips due to the altitude sickness medication, we had a pretty restless night. Nevertheless, we were up by 7:30. After getting everything packed, we took a quick cab ride to the bus terminal and, with much confusion, ended up on a bus to Latacunga, a waypoint towards Quilotoa.

At Latacunga, we were dropped off at the side of the road next to very little actual civilization. After wandering for a while and asking for help, we found that many buses just stopped at this middle-of-nowhere station and we just had to wait for something to Quilotoa or to another waypoint called Zumbahua. After around 20 minutes, a bus to Zumbahua arrived, and without a schedule to consult, we decided not to wait around for a direct bus.

> ‚ÄúThough the public/private bus systems had some signage on them, they were relatively confusing to navigate, and this was made all the worse by the fact that both of us were wandering around the side of the road with painfully full bladders. Thankfully, each bus came with it‚Äôs own guy hanging out the door yelling the direction the bus was going in, and we somehow got on a bus to Zumbahua. Even more amazingly - that bus made multiple bathroom stops.‚Äù ~Keshav

In Zumbahua, we were quickly confronted by a man with an old pickup truck offering to drive us to Quilotoa for $5. We weren‚Äôt sure how buses there worked, so we accepted. This ended up being surprisingly quick and painless as well as the recommended method of transport. Upon arrival in Quilotoa, we wandered around until we had found a hostel I had heard of in some blog post, so we haggled and booked a room. This, unlike the room in Quito, had 3 full-size beds. The hostel also had a semi-stray dog which seemed to enjoy spending time in the lobby.

After dropping off our stuff, we walked around the town and went into some sweater shops before heading to our true destination, the Quilotoa Lagoon. This is a beautiful blue-green lake which has formed in the crater of a dormant volcano in the depths of the Andes Mountain. We hiked a steep and sandy trail for around 30 minutes down before renting kayaks to get out on the lake itself. Finally, we spent around an hour hiking the steep path back up to the rim.

{{< figure src="/imgs/south-america/0005.jpg" caption="Ready for the descent to the Lagoon.">}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/south-america/0006.jpg" caption="Keshav in a kayak.">}}

Once we got to the top, we went straight back to the hostel and collapsed on our third and generally unused bed. The altitude (4000m) had made the hike up incredibly tiring, and we had stopped at least once every 5 minutes. This pace was still fast enough to pass multiple groups of people and some people riding mules, which seemed to be a popular choice for the ascent. After somewhat recovering, we made a quick trip out for food.

> ‚Äúthe 280m up the crater was brutal. We literally fought against headache, exhaustion, and nausea to stay ahead of the mules, and even still had to stop every 3‚Äì5 minutes. Each step felt like our legs weight three times their normal weight, and this was made even more difficult when we sank into the sandy portions of the trail. It was the hardest hike I‚Äôd ever done, but I‚Äôm proud to say that we didn‚Äôt need the mules üí™.‚Äù ~Keshav

When we got back, we realized our hostel also has a large an adorable bunny which wanders the lobby. It came by to give a few cursory sniffs before returning to its former activities. We headed back to the room to shower and realized that Quilotoa gets really cold at night (mid 30s F), and our room‚Äôs only heating source is a wood furnace. Since no one was at the front desk to light it, we showered and immediately burrowed into the many layers of blankets until someone came to help.

After lighting the stove, we relaxed with the comfort of devices + wifi before sleeping at around 10pm.

### 7/4: Quilotoa Part 2

Exhausted from yesterday‚Äôs acclimatization and hike, we slept for around 10 hours before finally venturing out at around 9am. While we were too winded for a hike around the entire crater rim (approx. 5 hours), we decided to spend around 90 minutes going for part of the way and coming back.

Before the hike, Keshav stopped for a cup of coffee and I filled the time by petting one of the many friendly stray dogs which wandered the town. As we headed to the crater and began the hike, the dog followed along.

{{< figure src="/imgs/south-america/0008.jpg" caption="The first time I met our dog friend.">}}

As we hiked the rim, we faced the stunning Quilotoa lagoon (which looked even better today in the morning light) to our left and the Andes mountains to our right. A plethora of red, yellow, and purple wildflowers decorated the landscapes to both sides.

{{< figure src="/imgs/south-america/0014.jpg" caption="The pink hand sanitizer bottle makes the whole scene.">}}

While we were tempted to just finish the loop, we decided to turn back when we hit a steeply descending portion of the trail made all the more difficult by the fact that we were carrying our full packs today instead of just a couple water bottles like yesterday. While our furry companion seemed disappointed by our choice, we turned around and headed back to town, taking plenty of pictures along the way.

Our way back to Quito was just as complex as our route to Quilotoa, though it felt more comfortable given our familiarity with the process. Some fun moments included running to jump onto a moving bus and having a grandma/grandpa/small child squish into our pickup truck with us during the route back from Quilotoa to Zumbahua. The three of them paid $1 total in contrast to the $4 Keshav and I paid, but we expected we were getting the tourist rates. In addition, the bus to Quito was a local bus which went much more slowly than expected, but it had a Spanish dubbed action movie playing on a screen in front, so we weren‚Äôt too disappointed.

> ‚ÄúThe Spanish dubbed movie playing on our bus was the XXX sequel. You can imagine it was comforting to see the familiar and friendly face of Deepika Padukone on a bus in the middle of nowhere in Ecuador during our arduous outing to Quilotoa.‚Äù ~Keshav

After arriving in Quitumbe, we took a cab to Hotel Baltico by the Quito city center and checked in. We dropped off our stuff, and walked down the street to Uku Pacha, a lovely hole in the wall restaurant. We had been mostly surviving on food from home due to Quilotoa‚Äôs general lack of vegetarian food, but the pesto pasta and veggie burger we got at Uku Pacha were a wonderful first real meal of the trip.

Next, we spent a couple hours wandering around the Historic Center neighborhood and saw a bunch of beautiful Spanish colonial architecture. We also stopped at a few shops and picked up some of Ecuador‚Äôs famously good chocolate. My favorite flavor was the passion fruit dark chocolate!

Finally, we headed back to make plans for tomorrow.

### 7/5: Quito Part 2

Thankfully we slept early last night as we were woken up this morning at around 6:30am by a smug-looking bird pecking and flapping outside our window. After shooing it away, we fell back asleep for a bit before getting up and eating our hotel-provided breakfast of eggs and croissants.

We started the day‚Äôs exploring with the Bas√≠lica del Voto Nacional, the largest neo-gothic basilica in the Americas. We climbed staircases and ladders to the top of a spire and a clock-tower and got amazing views of the city.

{{< figure src="/imgs/south-america/0030.jpg" caption="View from the clock tower.">}}

After this, we joined a free walking tour which went through much of the historic center of the city. The tour started by taking us to a central downtown market with cheap traditional food and an amazing variety of fruits and flowers. Early in the tour, I learned that Uber actually operates in Quito, but it was still a bit jolting to see a sign for Uber Eats sticking out from one of the stalls.

{{< figure src="/imgs/south-america/0031.jpg" caption="Ecuadorian roses.">}}

After the market, the tour overlapped quite a bit with our exploration yesterday, but we were able to learn a lot more about the things we saw plus we were also able to go into several more of the churches. In addition, we went to the Central Bank and learned about the crazy inflationary time in Ecuador‚Äôs history which lead to the adoption of the US dollar.

{{< figure src="/imgs/south-america/0034.jpg" caption="Iglesia y Convento de San Francisco (San Francisco Church)">}}

After the tour, we got a tamale, an empanada de viento, and a glass of canelazo from a spot on Calle Ronda. We had heard South American corn was amazing, but had shied away from buying it street stalls due to food safety concerns. As a result, the tamale was absolutely amazing. We also enjoyed the canelazo, a warm Andean rum-based cocktail, thought the empanada de viento was a bit too oily for our tastes.

Next, we headed to a more modern part of Quito: La Mariscal. Here, we went into a variety of artisanal markets to see hats, sweaters, and jewelry before stopping for dinner at El Maple, a well-known vegetarian restaurant. Our meal of fake-meat enchiladas and stuffed portobello mushrooms was the best food we‚Äôve had so far this trip.

After dinner, we went back to get things packed up. With this, our time in mainland Ecuador has come to an end. Next stop (and next blog post): Galapagos Islands.
