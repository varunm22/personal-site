### 04/06/20-04/12/20 (fourth week home)

Over the start of this week, my starter slowly bubbled and rose! I didn't want to throw away my discard, so the starter grew day by day until Wednesday, when I decided it had matured enough at least to be used for sourdough pancakes! To commorate this first use, we decided it was time to name the starter, and we chose Leopold.

To make these, I mixed the starter with some flour and water Wednesday night and let them sit until Thursday morning, when we mixed the rest of the ingredients into the batter to make the pancakes. They turned out delicious with an amazing flavor and the softest, most melty texture I had ever had in a pancake. I definitely want to make these again, potentially using some or all whole wheat next time.

Later that day, I was browsing Reddit and saw something that reminded me of the babybel wax dinos I made at work in November, so I decided to post them. Throughout the day, I slowly saw my post rise through r/mildlyinteresting until it was one of the hottest posts in the subreddit. At that point, I tried scrolling through r/all and found it on the fifth page! Over the next couple hours, it crept up until it finally made it to the top of the second page. At this point, it started to fall, oscillating between being around the 3rd top post on the second page to being the 6th. I watched this with dread, realizing its popularity may have peaked just too low for the post to reach the front page. Suddenly, it jumped to #24 (front page is top 25)! I'm officially internet famous! Shortly after reaching the front page, I received a message inviting me to the eternity club!

Friday afternoon, I judged Leopold ready to produce the first loaf. Following the [King Arthur No-Knead recipe][1], I started making the dough Friday night, then left it to proof in the fridge from Friday night until Sunday morning when I baked it. The finished result was not horrible! The rise was ok, but the loaf was still quite dense in the middle. Also, the sour flavor wasn't too developed, but it was edible bread!

The strange and unpredictable weather we'd been having all week finally culminated in a snowstorm which left several inches of snow on our deck. With nothing better to do on a Sunday in quarantine, I decided to try making a snow dinosaur. This had been a bucket list item in the back of my mind since early high school, and I can confidently say I crossed it off. 

With volunteering, I've started figuring out my role in Citizens' Climate Lobby (CCL), and also got in contact with someone working on tech solutions for COVID triage for Bangladeshi communities in NYC. Both of these seem like they may be cool ways to feel useful in these times!

### 04/13/20-04/19/20 (fifth week home)

With every passing week, the days seem to be passing faster. Based on the fact that I have a proper work week schedule, I imagine it's easier for me to keep track of days than it is for most people, but it's still an ongoing struggle to differentiate weekday leisure time from weekends enough to have something to look forward to. Not an unsuccessful struggle, but one all the same.

One other interesting side effect of quarantine is more intense dreams. These have often been relatively ordinary settings like going to movie theaters or dinner parties with a variety of people from high school and college present, but they've felt much more vivid and easy to remember. This effect seems to also be present with mild dream-like states during daily meditation sessions. 

One way that work at least has been trying to fight the drudgery on our behalf is to plan weekly fun activities. This week's was something I'd been looking forward to for a long time: a cheese tasting! Murray's Cheese sent us 4 different types of cheese (French double-creme brie, white lake rachel, comte saint antuine, combozola black label) in addition to pairings (fresh strawberry jam, celery relish, rosemary marcona almonds, oatcakes). Then on Tuesday afternoon, we joined a webinar where a cheese expert talked us through how the cheeses were made and what to pay attention to in tasting. The amount they gave us was more than enough for all 4 of us to enjoy the tasting and for multiple rounds of snacking later!

Mom's been experimenting with fun food stuff while we've been home, the latest of which is Cilbir, a Turkish egg dish consisting of poached eggs in yogurt with various spices and toast. This is definitely a keeper!

By Friday, I was ready to try loaf number two. I was a little apprehensive since my starter didn't seem to have improved that much since the last loaf, but the rest of my family seemed to believe that mediocre bread is better than no bread, so I charged forward. I made this loaf bigger and using bread flour, which we had obtained since last week. 

While we thought we improved on the techniques in making the loaf, unfortunately it rose even less than the last one. Thankfully, the starter had at least progressed in its ability to create flavor, because this loaf was more pleasantly tangy. With thin cut slices toasted on a skillet, I liked it better than the last one! Still, based on videos I had seen of example dough, I think the dough I made was too dry, likely because I wasn't able to precisely measure flour by using volume. For this reason and to be more precise with my starter, I decided to put Leopold in the fridge and order a food scale to more precisely measure feedings for my new starter.

On Sunday, the food scale arrived, and I started my new starter: Chatsworth! I've also heard whole wheat flour works well for starters, so Chatsworth was started with whole wheat flour only.

Also this weekend, at one point, we noticed an Amazon delivery truck pull up outside. A few seconds later, we heard a scream, and we rushed to the door. There, we saw the delivery woman running back to her truck after tossing the package to the door. In our lawn, we noticed a couple small garter snakes soaking up sun. The delivery woman snuck back to "take the picture", but it took me a second to realize she meant a picture of the delivered package, not of the snakes.

While we've generally been doing pretty long walks, this weekend, we decided to walk through a trail in Rice Creek Regional Park. This was surprisingly scenic and nice, and we ended up walking over 5 miles in all. We all were a little sore after getting back, but definitely will do this again.

Besides bread, this weekends culinary experiments were fluffy Japanese pancakes and Mala project style dry pot stir fry. The former was entirely my mom's work, but we happily enjoyed it! The texture was not quite what I expected, but we'll definitely make it again. The Mala dry pot was led by Keshav with me as sous chef, and was also excellent. To get the characteristic complex flavor, we cooked around a dozen unique spices in oil for 20 minutes!

### 04/20/20-04/26/20 (sixth week home)

Tuesday this week brought another work sponsored activity: terrarium making! For this, they sent us a glass globe, soil, two succulents, and various decorative elements. On video chat, an instructor taught us about how to care for the plants and led us through putting together the terrarium, though of course, we had some artistic liberty.

This was a big cooking week for me and the family. The first was fresh foccashia bread (as part of an Italian lunch) my mom made on Wednesday. Unfortunately, Chatsworth has been quite finicky, so we did use commercial yeast, but the bread rose wonderfully and tasted amazing with the spices and toppings included.

The second dish, made Friday and also led by mom, was fresh corn tortillas (as part of a Mexican dinner). These were made from Masa Harina, corn flour treated with an alkaline solution. While mom lead the process, I at least got to help flip them. They tasted great with all of our standard toppings!

The next two dishes were both part of cooking classes organized by work through The Chef and the Dish. Saturday's class was mushroom risotto! I had never made risotto, but this turned out amazing, partially through the copious use of butter and proper parmesan (including using the rinds for extra flavor). The class itself was quite well organized with a kitchen assistant watching for questions from any of the 8ish participants and an Paola, accomplished chef based in Milan leading the way and critiquing our efforts. As we'd go through the steps, Paola would call people out one by one "Baron show me your dish... beautiful beautiful!". Paola also described a variant I'm excited to try which substitutes the dried porcini mushrooms for strawberries!

Risotto by nature tends to stiffen up fairly quickly, so I followed Paola's suggestion for the leftovers and cooked them low and slow on butter into a crispy gooey risotto cake Sunday night. The caramelized crust and rich interior were absolutely incredible and possibly the tastiest (and maybe least healthy) thing I've ever made.

Sunday's class was Spanish tortilla! Unlike Mexican tortillas, Spanish tortillas are actually potato omelettes. While this class was also lots of fun, the end product wasn't quite as satisfying as the risotto. Still, I definitely want to do more of these.

Now to revisit some of the continually running threads. First off: Leopold vs Chatsworth. Based on some experimentation, it seems like Leopold does better with all purpose flour than with whole wheat, and slight better when given water that's sat out long enough to be dechlorinated. Chatsworth has been struggling and at one point was giving off some very concerning smells, but now, both starters seem to be doing decently.

I've continued with meditation, occasional exercise, and piano. In addition, I've started doing some actual work with CCL, and I'm definitely excited to have this as part of my routine here.
