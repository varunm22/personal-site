### 03/11/20-03/15/20 (start of work from home)

Right around this time, work decided it was time for us to all start working from home due to the escalation of the covid-19 situation. Over the last week, due to the reduced focus on cybersecurity and the increased focus on getting people remote-ready, my personal workload had included more setting up devices for remote work, but now that I'm working from home, it's time to get back to my normal work. 

Work from home means I have a lot more time at home to put pent up energy into chores. In these first couple days, I cooked more quesadillas, more chole, and tried palak paneer for the first time! In addition, I did multiple loads of laundry, cleaned my floors, and organized my room.

During the working days themselves, I needed excuses for breaks during the day in absence of team chatter, so I got in the habit of daily short runs and meditation, the latter being inspired by [this video][1] (credit to Jess). Between the running, meditation, and having at least 1 of my roommates to hang out with, I wasn't feeling too cooped up for now.

Still, by the weekend, I felt a bit socially starved, so Anurag came over to chill and watch TV, then we decided to find a fancy bar for cocktails. We decided on Undercote, a fancy bar named as such because it exists in the basement of the restaurant Cote. The bar had an amazing ambiance with large wall fixtures filled with living plants. The drinks were unique and delicious; my first using catnip infused vodka and my second including color-changing butterfly pea flower dye.

The next day, I went to hang out at my brother's apartment, and we started to discuss whether we should head back to Minnesota, since the longer we waited, the more risky travel would be. I was hesitant as I wasn't sure yet if I could work remotely from Minnesota. After much discussion and a phone call with my boss's boss, we decided it was safest to just go, and I'd use vacation days and/or unpaid leave until the remote work situation could be resolved. At 10pm, we bought 6am tickets for the next morning, and I rushed home to get things packed.

### 03/16/20-03/22/20 (first week home - quarantine in basement)

I woke up at around 3am, scarfed down whatever leftovers I had left in my fridge, and headed to the airport with a stop to pick up my brother along the way. I realized I had left my plants behind, but they're succulents, so they've evolved for this.

The airport was incredibly empty, and we were able to get to our gate without too much contact with others. On our flight, we each had a row to ourselves, the entirety of which we wiped down with Clorox wipes just to be safe. Even so, once we landed and our parents came to pick us up, we maintained as much distance as possible. We spent much of the car ride convincing our reluctant parents of the importance of our self-quarantine upon arriving at home.

Soon as we got home, my brother and I went straight to the basement and got set up with extra mattresses. We were both exhausted from the early flight, so this first day was mostly dedicated to napping and getting settled in. I hadn't figured out yet whether I was legally allowed to work remotely, but I was tired enough to use the day off regardless. As we went to sleep, the night was strangely quiet and dark, far from New York City. 

On Tuesday, I got the go-ahead to get back to work, so I got set up on our basement wet bar with an old and annoyingly low-resolution TV as a second monitor. It was just about tall enough to work as a standing desk, but unfortunately, we didn't have tall enough chairs to comfortably sit for when I was tired or my toes started to freeze on the strangely cold floor (which was annoyingly colder in that corner than anywhere else in the basement). I took to standing on a pillow for some minimal insulation.

Throughout the week, with little else to entertain us, my brother and I played plenty of ping pong and watched several movies including Snowpiercer and Inglorious Basterds (both excellent). While our parents couldn't come spend time with us in the basement, we would still enjoy meals together talking to each other from the bottom to the top of the stairwell.

Slightly later in the week, I switched teams at work from Cybersecurity to one of the Trading Systems teams, as they had a lot more high priority work that needed to get done. I was excited for the change of pace, though onboarding would certainly be tougher remotely.

Thursday this week, I attended my first virtual rehearsal for Voices of Gotham, my barbershop group. Virtual rehearsal is still of course no substitute for singing together in person, though it's a decent way to stay in contact and keep familiar with the music.

Finally, by Friday, we hadn't shown any more symptoms, and we decided it was time to head up. This was partially determined by what we thought was adequate risk reduction and partially determined by the fact that Friday was my brother's (now virtual) Match Day! This is when he found out what hospital he was contractually obligated to be a resident at for the next three years. 

As we awaited the results, we set up a full spread complete with tons of food, wine, scotch (my birthday Lagavulin 16 distiller's edition which I cracked open for the occasion), and a fancy tablecloth. We started several video calls with friends and family and waited until the email came in. He matched at NYU Tisch Kimmel, his first choice!

With upstairs opened up, I got back to one of my favorite home hobbies: piano. This started out with playing and singing Happiness by Rex Orange County!

### 03/23/20-03/29/20 (second week home - ascending to the ground floor)

I started off this work week with a brand new setup upstairs in the sun room. Here, we have a standing height table, so I set up my laptop and monitor on cardboard boxes to adjust my screens to the right height. With windows now surrounding me, I'm getting plenty more daylight and opportunity to watch the plentiful wildlife in my backyard. In addition, I swapped out the TV for a real monitor, which is much easier on my eyes.

With time outside work I've gotten into more of a set of routine. Nearly every day, I rope my mom and brother into a 15 minute medition break in the early afternoon, and after I'm done with work, we'll go on walks of various lengths (usually 2-3.5 miles). Slightly less frequently, I've been working out (running/lifting/Barry's ig workout vids), setting up video chats with friends, and continuing to play piano. I've definitely found I've been getting very out of shape just from the lack of normal walking/stairs as part of my morning commute. 

Overall, work has been more exciting with my new team, but as expected, onboarding is harder remotely. Nothing's quite the same as having someone sitting next to you to bother every 5 minutes with questions.

Our second weekend was pretty relaxed, and we started finding the most ancient piles of clutter in our house to clear out. We're slowly building piles of books, clothes, and other things to donate once we can actually get out to donate them!

### 03/30/20-04/05/20 (third week home)

As we headed out for our Monday walk, we spotted our first (at least for me and my brother) snake of the season! As the weather continues to improve, we'll hopefully see more of them! 

{{< figure src="/imgs/life/2020/0034.jpg" >}}

After coming home from our walk, we decided to "meet" Sajel and Sanjana and their parents for a driveway party. This just involved each of us eating and drinking our own snacks and refreshments while talking from opposite sides of their driveway! Not as fun as a proper hangout, but it's the best we can do for now.

Though I had been looking forward to the weather improving, it has been as finicky as I've ever seen Minnesota weather be. While we've generally been enjoying daily walks, a string of cold days this week has threatened that. Thankfully, by the weekend, things warmed up a bit.

Late last week, we realized we had several gift cards for large retail stores which we felt we should use quickly, just in case those stores went out of business. This week, the first of the resulting purchases arrived: a standing mat! This slab of dense foam/gel substance is so nice to stand on while working. 

{{< figure src="/imgs/life/2020/0072.jpg" >}}

During the weekend, another work setup related purchase arrived: a really long ethernet cable. I spent some time this weekend putting thumbtacks and command strips along the wall to suspend 75 ft of cable high enough to be out of the way all the way from the router to my workstation. This was hugely helpful in reducing latency on my work laptop.

Our big event of the week this week was my brother's remote early graduation! Once again, we set up a full spread and got the video chats started. This time, there was more ceremony from the medical school's end with many short speeches from prominent doctors and a coordinated recitation of the Hippocratic Oath from the graduating students. Graduation had been moved up from its original date in late May to allow for the graduating students to join their respective residency programs to battle COVID early. We're still not sure if Keshav will have to go early, but either way, he's officially a doctor now and ready when he's needed. [Read more about this in the New York Times!][1].

Shortly after the ceremony, we got a call from Anish telling us to go outside. He, Simran, Kunal, and Kush had driven from Woodbury and Plymouth to congratulate him in person! We talked for a while, all spread out upon our lawn, but the 30 degree weather eventually put a stop to the festivities. Later in the evening, we played a compilation of short congratulatory videos that friends and family had sent in. The next day, we decided to hold a series of Zoom graduation parties consisting of my mom's side of the family, my dad's side of the family, and our close family friends respectively. These were a great way both to see everyone, but also to consolidate a lot of my brother's phone calls into a single block.

This weekend, I also had a couple culinary developments. First off, I attempted [mapo tofu][1] again (after my first try in August 2019), and it turned out really well! I think it could have benefitted from a dangerously high quantity of chili oil and from having actual shaoxing cooking wine, but those can be fixed for next time.

I also decided to join in on one of the seemingly popular pandemic trends: making sourdough! I started a starter with some all purpose flour and water, which I hope to eventually turn into bread!

Also this weekend, my parents finally got fed up enough with my far too long hair and decided to take matters into their own hands. While poorly done home haircuts seem to also be a pretty common quarantine trend, thankfully I did not have to join this one, since my dad usually cuts his own hair even before quarantine. While my haircut didn't turn out perfectly, it was better than anything I could have done myself, and I can always adjust it again next week.

This week, I started to get involved with a volunteering organization I'd been looking into called Citizens' Climate Lobby. I've been wanting to get involved with volunteering in some way, and I'm excited to spend some of my quarantine free time learning more!
