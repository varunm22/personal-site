### 10/03/19

Today's dessert buffet at work included 8 beautiful cakes from Paris Baguette, and while I've enjoyed the taste of the desserts in some other dessert buffets more, I've never put together as aesthetic of a plate as what I made today. Observe: 7 thin slices of 7 delicious cakes arranged symmetrically.

The complex my office building is a part of puts on frequent events, and today, that was a performance of music by Steve Reich: a composer of minimalist contemporary music. This free concert featured Piano Phase, a piece I had listened to previously, as well as three other songs I hadn't heard (My Name Is, Four Organs, and New York Counterpoint), and all of them were fantastic.

### 10/18/19-10/19/19

On the 18th, we finally got around to throwing a housewarming party! We squeezed just about as many people as possible into our compact apartment, but as the night wore on and the crowd thinned, we enjoyed long conversations with close friends deep into the night.

Of course, I felt a bit unfortunate the next morning, so I met up with some of the same friends to visit a slew of eateries where we had pho, dumplings, and Japanese shaved ice. The shaved ice (straberries and cream flavor from Kakigori) was amazing and something I'd easily rate in my top 5 favorite NYC desserts.

### 10/22/19

After making various vaguely East Asian noodle dishes, I finally got around to making Indian food. This was my first attempt at making chole, which was both easier and tastier than expected.

Apparently the MoMA recently opened after a big renovation, so I joined Sid and one of his med school friends to check it out. The top floor had several rooms, each of which was set up as an exhibit by a particular modern artist. These new exhibits were fantastically varied, including (but not limited to) eerie death robots, small children singing diss opera, and tiny experimental city scapes. After the museum, we checked out the MoMA Design Store, which was an amazing place to browse.

### 10/27/19

Keshav and I took a train out to New Jersey to celebrate Diwali with our relatives there. Away from the city, we enjoyed catching up with them over good homemade food and backyard fireworks.

One of the fairly enthusiastic subcultures at work centers around the pizza mailing list, where people plan trips to the best pizzarias of NYC. Today was a "slice crawl" visiting three establishments along the upper west side. The last (and best) destination was Mama's Too. The slices here were all good, but the real gem was the cacio e pepe slice, based on the Roman pecorino and black pepper pasta.

### 10/31/19

I had never really taken Halloween very seriously in college, but as a full-fledged, tax-paying adult, it was time to step up my game. I didn't have any creative ideas, but I do have an inflatable dinosaur suit (courtesy of Josh/Neha from my 22nd bday). To make the most of this, I decided to wear it to work.

I wanted it to seem like I had worn the costume during my commute, but I really didn't want to wear it during my commute, so upon entering the office, I ducked in a bathroom to get changed before getting to my desk. The effect was fantastic, though I wasn't able to keep it on for too long since the plastic view window is a bit too blurry to code through.
