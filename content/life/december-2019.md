### 12/05/19

My first work holiday party included plenty of food, drinks, and speeches. Of course, the main event was followed with obligatory karaoke. During the main party, I played a game with my coworkers at the open bar where we each ordered a weird drink for the next person in the circle and challenged them to guess its content (and actually finish it). I think I was given a mix of rum and elderflower liqueur, which was cloyingly sweet, but not horrible otherwise. I, on the other hand, passed along a mix of rum, tequila, and red wine.

### 12/06/19-12/08/19 (boston)

This weekend, I went to Boston to celebrate Neha's birthday! This started off with ramen at Santuoka. We waited for a table in a nearby bookshop.

Ended up joining another friend's birthday the next day and met up with these two!

### 12/15/19-12/19/19 (misc things)

Cooked a black bean noodle stir fry with my friend Anurag and his girlfriend Taylor. Fresh veggies like green onions and bok choy are a huge improvement over the frozen veggies I've used in my stir fry dishes.

A couple days later, at work, everyone received multiple emergency notifications for something called a "snow squall". As each alert came through, every phone in the row buzzed and beeped until finally, we decided to experience the squall for ourselves. Our trip out to the balcony started with snow angels and ended with a snowball fight which prompted office staff to bring us back and and close the balcony temporarily.

The next day, we had a work dinner with a constantly replenished plate of burrata cheese, which was by far the best dish of the night.

### 12/20/19-12/29/19 (christmas break-ish)

Since I used to use a week of PTO, it's time for Christmas break-ish! During my flight home, I sat next to an amazingly friendly therapy dog that I now follow on instagram (shoutout to @kilo.thehuskyshepherd).

After a couple days at home with family and friends, we headed to San Diego for a warm weather family vacation with Sajel, Sanjana and their family. While New York generally has fantastic food, San Diego definitely has it beat on Mexican food.

We also enjoyed a variety of natural scenery through La Jolla beach walks and the Potato Chip rock hike.

Given that we were there for Christmas, we decided to do impromptu secret santa with $20 and 30 minutes at a fancy mall. I ended up having to get a gift for my mom, which is always difficult since if I knew of something cheap and easy to find that she'd like, I would have gotten it for her by now. 

Around the end of our time limit, all I had bought so far was a glass water bottle, and I had $10 left. I went to a fancy soap/lotion store, explained my situation, and asked for suggestions. The cashier was entertained enough that she ended up just giving me a bunch of free soaps, so I definitely ended up winning secret santa.

Each night when we returned from the day's plans, our routine consisted of some combination of hot tub, movies, and various drinks (scotch, wine, white claw). One night in the hot tub, we met a family who had kids who went to the same high school as us. The next night, we met a jeweler from Israel who had apparently had business dealings with my dad 20 years ago, and remembered having dinner with my parents. 

At some point this trip, we went on a whale watching tour. It was cold, windy, and VERY nauseating. For all our pain, we didn't see a single whale, though we did catch a glimpse of a dolphin.
