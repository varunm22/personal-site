### 02/08/20 (mac and cheese pancakes??)

For Saturday morning brunch, I met up with Manjekah, a friend from Australia that I hadn't seen since we meet in 2014 at a high school biology competition. We ate at Mom's kitchen, and I had some weird and delicious mac and cheese pancakes!

### 02/08/20 (rex orange county!)

Later that evening, I met up with Jess (friend from work) for a concert by Rex Orange County, who has been probably my favorite artist over the last month or two. The concert was absolutely amazing. Rex sounded great live, was a ton of fun to watch, and seemed so genuine.

### 02/14/20-02/16/20 (hmmt+valentine's day)

Jane street runs a recruiting event at the Harvard-MIT Math Tournament, so I tagged along to help out. This involved running a hectic Estimathon (Fermi-style questions) event for an auditorium of high school students and talking to college internship offerees at a happy hour. 

The tournament happened to be on Valentine's day, so I took advantage of the free trip to have a Valentine's lunch with Neha on Friday at Myers and Chang. After my company recruiting efforts were done late Friday evening, I had the rest of the weekend to spend with Neha and to meet up with other friends and family in the area.

### 02/21/20-02/23/20 (bday weekend)

The next weekend, Neha came to NYC to celebrate my birthday weekend. She's always let me navigate us through the city streets and subway stations, but many of our destinations this weekend were surprises to me. Neha, slightly flustered, lead me into the E train and down to W 4th St where we walked over to our first stop: Saigon Shack! Here, we met up with my brother, Kunal, and Ravina for amazing bahn me sandwiches.

Next, we headed over to famous cocktail bar The Dead Rabbit where Shriya joined us and we drank several amazing drinks. Eventually, we went our separate ways for the night.

The next morning, Neha lead the way again, this time bringing me to Michelin starred vegetarian restaurant Nix for an amazing brunch.

Later that evening, I hosted a birthday get-together at my apartment with several friends, plenty of homemade cocktails, and pizza. The next day, Neha and I relaxed, cooked and watched Netflix to recover from the rest of the weekend.

### trend watch

Throughout the month, I started paying attention to the "trend watch" advertisements on giant screens lining the last walking portion of my commute to work. While some of the "trends" were reasonable, on average they were strange and horrifying. I wonder what the qualifications are of the person coming up with these, and whether they're attempting to observe existing trends or start their own. Either way I enjoyed the opportunity to watch trend watch trends.

### 02/24/20 (tv filming?)

As I left my apartment this morning, I noticed cameras, lights, and cones sitting on the sidewalk a couple hundred feet from my apartment. One of the people I asked on set said they were filming Law & Order SVU, so I hope I can find out what episode that happens in.

### 02/25/20 (xfair)

When it rains, it pours: I told Jane Street that I wanted to attend more recruiting events, so they sent me to a second one within the month: MIT's xFair (a smaller, tech-focused career fair). This was my first time being on the company side of a career fair booth, which was fun, but extremely exhausting. After standing and talking all day, I was wiped out and ready for a calm train ride back. 

As a bonus, the trip was another opportunity to visit Neha!

### 02/27/20 (levain @ dessert buffet)

Today we had another famous NYC dessert catered at our dessert buffey: Levain Bakery cookies! These cookies are known for being huge and having a wonderful range of textures throughout the cookie.
