After returning from my South America trip, I had a couple weeks to relax and get prepped for my move to New York. My first weekend back, I went to Interstate State Park in Taylor Falls with family and some extended family to go kayaking on the St. Croix river. This particular route involves spending around 2 hours kayaking 7 miles down calm water surrounded by beautiful foliage, rock cliffs, and occasional sand bars. By the end, we were sore and very ready for a picnic.

Afterwards, we drove to the very nearby Franconia Sculpture Park. Our experience here was far from what I would have expected from a free sculpture park in Minnesota out in the countryside. The art was well thought out with museum-style placards. More interestingly, most of the pieces were designed to be climbed on. We certainly obliged.

My 6 weeks of travel in South America had involved a conspicuous lack of shaving, but with my return to society, it was time for the beard to go. I've conclusively determined that at this point in my life, I cannot properly grow a beard.

Also while I was gone, my dad had gotten my last two broken watches fixed, so between those, my pre-trip watch, and my backpacking watch, I ended up a little paralyzed by choice.

In preparation for a real adult life, I decided to make use of my fully stocked home kitchen to experiment before I move to my apartment. My mom has set me up for some basic Indian dishes, but I also decided to try making homemade seitan to be used in a "Mongolian Beef" dish and mapo tofu. Both turned out excellent, though the mapo tofu was a bit hard to flavor just right.

Between apartment stocking shopping trips, we celebrated my brother Keshav's birthday with some friends who came from out of town to join. It was a great way to get settled into New York!
