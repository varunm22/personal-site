Neha come to NYC this weekend to celebrate our 1 year anniversary! We had a weekend chock-full of fun plans. Saturday night started with dinner at my favorite ramen spot Ippudo. This was Neha's first time having proper ramen, and she was very impressed with the experience. 

Next, we headed to Broadway to watch The Book of Mormon. This show was a lot of fun, and based on the style of music and characters, it was easy to guess it came from a collaboration of the creators of South Park and the creator of Avenue Q (a comedic Broadway show which now runs off Broadway). 

Our final destination of the night was to the secretive cocktail bar Please Don't Tell. Hidden in a space adjacent to a casual hot dog restaurant, the only way to enter is through a secret door at the back of a phone booth. More importantly, the only way to be allowed to enter is with a reservation made day-of. To get this reservation, my brother and I collectively called around 80 times starting right at 3pm before we were able to get through to someone, but it was definitely worth it for the whole experience as well as the amazing drinks. Our favorite was inspired by Elotes (aka grilled Mexican street corn). 

Next morning's brunch was South Indian food at Saranava Bhavan, where Neha ordered me some of her favorite South Indian dishes. Afterwards, we walked over to the Museum of Math. This museum is tons of fun for anyone, but especially so for Neha since she's a huge math nerd.

After the museum, we went to Soho and waited outside for 20+ minutes to get dessert at Dominique Ansel, famous for first inventing the cronut. While they were out of cronuts by the time we arrived, we had plenty of other amazing desserts including cookie and milk shots. After this, we were pretty pooped and just wandered into a nearby Italian restaurant for dinner.
