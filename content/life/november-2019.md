### 11/02/19-11/04/19

Neha came to NYC this weekend to celebrate our 1 year anniversary! We had a weekend chock-full of fun plans. Saturday night started with dinner at my favorite ramen spot Ippudo. This was Neha's first time having proper ramen, and she was very impressed with the experience. 

Next, we headed to Broadway to watch The Book of Mormon. This show was a lot of fun, and based on the style of music and characters, it was easy to guess it came from a collaboration of the creators of South Park and the creator of Avenue Q (a comedic Broadway show which now runs off Broadway).

Our final destination of the night was to the secretive cocktail bar Please Don't Tell. Hidden in a space adjacent to a casual hot dog restaurant, the only way to enter is through a secret door at the back of a phone booth. More importantly, the only way to be allowed to enter is with a reservation made day-of. To get this reservation, my brother and I collectively called around 80 times starting right at 3pm before we were able to get through to someone, but it was definitely worth it for the whole experience as well as the amazing drinks. Our favorite was inspired by Elotes (aka grilled Mexican street corn).

Next morning's brunch was South Indian food at Saranava Bhavan, where Neha ordered me some of her favorite South Indian dishes. Afterwards, we walked over to the Museum of Math. This museum is tons of fun for anyone, but especially so for Neha since she's a huge math nerd.

After the museum, we went to Soho and waited outside for 20+ minutes to get dessert at Dominique Ansel, famous for first inventing the cronut. While they were out of cronuts by the time we arrived, we had plenty of other amazing desserts including cookie and milk shots. After this, we were pretty pooped and just wandered into a nearby Italian restaurant for dinner.

### 11/15/19-11/17/19

This weekend, a bunch of us friends flew to Chicago to surprise Anish and celebrate his 25th birthday. The days were filled with boozy brunches, boozier evenings, and wonderful late-night tacos.

At work, I realized babybell cheese wax wrapping is an excellent sculpting material, so I formed a few cheeses worth into a collection of dinosaurs for my desk!

On my way out of work, I noticed a new decoration put up in Brookfield place (the collection of buildings including my office).

Finally, it was my turn to attend an MIT Resonance concert as an alum in the audience rather than a performer on stage. The next day, I spent some time in Boston Commons with college friends and we witnessed a surprising amount of nature.

### 11/28/19-12/01/19

Thanksgiving brought my first time off work and trip back home since starting. As is our tradition, our family friend group spent each night partying and sleeping in different houses, with two of the parties celebrating anniversaries in the group, including my parents' 30th wedding anniversary!

At one point at home, we tried to make vadas and inadvertently created small, edible bombs. As the vadas fried, they expanded fast enough to explode, and in some cases, the inside refried.
