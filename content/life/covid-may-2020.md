### 05/04/20-05/10/20 (eighth week home)

This post starts off with a celebration of Neha's and my year and a half anniversary! While half anniversaries don't need to be a big deal, we're bored in quarantine and desparate for excuses to plan fun things. Today, we decided to make homemade pizza together over video chat, each using our own sourdough starters. We decided on 1 pesto and 1 tomato sauce pizza, but we'd each pick our own toppings.

For the pesto pizza, I used some of mom's homemade pesto along with sundried tomatoes, sliced black olives, and feta cheese. For the tomato sauce pizza, I followed my coworker's advice and handcrushed canned San Marzano tomatoes directly onto the crust with just a touch of salt and herbs. For toppings, I just added saut√©ed mushrooms and aged mozzerella.

Getting the crust to cook properly was a bit of a learning process, but both pizzas were enjoyable. We each took our share and enjoyed a wonderful home cooked meal together over video chat.

After this 5 day baking marathon of bread, pancakes, crackers, bread, then pizza, I decided it was time to relax a bit and put Chatsworth in the fridge for the first time. He's finally grown up, and I think he'll do alright. 

The rest of this week was fairly quiet. On Wednesday, we had some fun backyard sightings including a couple of owls and a very near helicopter. The owls were eventually driven away by a couple of very defensive robins who have a nest on our balcony.

My huge stash of starter discard was far from finished, so I made another batch of crackers. I did a better job at rolling these out so they turned out much more evenly baked, though they were a bit less crispy because I tried cutting the butter by a third and accidently used margarine instead of butter.

On Saturday, based on a friend's suggestion, I decided to try [a new sourdough recipe from America's Test Kitchen][1] which takes a much more hands-off approach. While I'm sure autolysis and rounds of folds throughout bulk rise do improve bread, I imagine those improvements apply mostly to loaves which are decently good to start. Unfortunately, my execution was imperfect. I initially forgot to add salt, so I had to add a bit of extra water to get it to dissolve into the dough, leaving it a bit too wet. In, since I left it overnight, the dough had 16 hours of bulk rise, which was far more than enough. The overproofed dough became a loose pile of goop.

At this point, there was little I could do to properly save it, so I split the dough into two parts and decided to bake it as is. For the first loaf, I skipped proofing and plopped it into the Dutch oven to bake starting with a cold oven like the video suggested. For the second loaf, I added enough flour to the outside to get it to hold together so I could bake it on a flat cast iron with the larger portion of the Dutch oven placed upside down over the bread. The latter approach produced a much nicer looking loaf and marginally nicer tasting one, but both were quite dense (but not horribly bad tasting).

Sunday morning, we also celebrated Mother's day with a wonderful batch of sourdough pancakes my brother and I made, this time with 2/3 less sugar and 1/3 less butter. We also made a plate of chocolate covered strawberries and raspberries to enjoy with afternoon tea.

### 05/11/20-05/17/20 (ninth week home)

On Monday, we enjoyed trying some new foods. My mom and brother experimented with our new air fryer and fried avocados to put in tacos, inspired by the fried avocado tacos we tried in Austin at Torchy's Tacos some years back. Our version, which had fried avocados, black beans, roasted veggies, red salsa, crack sauce, and Torchy's diablo hot sauce, was maybe even better than the original. 

{{< figure src="/imgs/life/2020/00.jpg" caption="The air-fried avocados, which used no oil and just a touch of nonstick spray">}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/life/2020/00.jpg" caption="Assembled taco">}}

The same day, I made Mala Peanuts for tomorrow's lunch, since I've heard they taste best the next day. Even then, they still didn't quite have the depth of flavor that the ones from Mala Project do, but the spices turned out very well. We ended up mixing them with fried rice, which was incredibly addicting and painful.

{{< figure src="/imgs/life/2020/00.jpg" caption="Very spicy peanuts">}}

On Tuesday, I had a cocktail class set up by work. In advance, we were sent a full bar kit to use. During the class, we made three cocktails, all shown below. All of the cocktails were great, though our family's ranking went garden spritz > smooth operator > isolation lemonade.

After the weekend's disappointing loaves, I decided Tuesday morning to try the same recipe again, but with a shorter bulk rise (12 hours instead of 16). This recipe was easy enough to do on a weekday so I mixed the dough before work and waited to shape, proof, and bake in the evening. While the dough still was a bit overproofed, it was not nearly as bad as last time. I proofed one loaf in the Dutch oven and baked it there starting from a cold oven (as the video suggested) and proofed the other loaf in a bowl to bake on preheated cast iron with the upside down Dutch oven bowl on top (as my last recipe suggested). 

The first loaf did not look very good coming out of the oven, which I expected as the flat proof made it lose a lot of tension. However, it still tasted really good and was comparable to or better than our good loaves from a week and a half a go. 

{{< figure src="/imgs/life/2020/00.jpg" caption="Looks pale and flat on the outside with no nice scoring">}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/life/2020/00.jpg" caption="Inside is surprisingly ok">}}

The second loaf, however, was clearly the best I've ever made. This rose amazingly well, had a well-developed crust (which wasn't too chewy), and a very even crumb. We decreed this good enough for us to knight Chatsworth, so from now on, he is to be known as Sir Chatsworth. The knighting ceremony was performed with a bread knife.

{{< figure src="/imgs/life/2020/00.jpg" caption="Best crumb!">}}

In honor of the knighting bread, we made avocado toast using my homemade bread. The bread was quite tough to chew through, but it tasted awesome!

This is just a miscellaneous picture, but I noticed our rosemary plant looked cool when the sun was behind it.

A few walks ago, we decided to try a new path which took us through Indian Hills Park and up towards Golden Lake. Between our previous walks in this area and the new branch we checked out today, we've traversed gorgeous paths going through marshlands full of wildlife. Today, our path also took us around Golden lake itself, and we enjoyed looking at the interesting architecture of the houses here.

On Saturday, Anish ran a virtual escape room/puzzle hunt for the rest of our friend group. This was lots of fun, and we definitely want to plan more of these sorts of things going forward!

On Sunday, I got my second haircut at home, this one done as a collab between mom and dad (dad started it, mom decided to do some polishing). I think it turned out well!

{{< figure src="/imgs/life/2020/00.jpg" >}}

Sunday was also a big day for baking. Among the last chunks of my bad loaves from last weekend, I noticed one was spotted with small bits of mold. We threw this out and decided to turn the remainder of our old bread into bread crumbs. This process involved cutting the dense bricks of bread into small pieces, toasting it to oblivion on the toaster oven, then pulverizing it in our blender.

{{< figure src="/imgs/life/2020/00.jpg" >}}

{{< figure src="/imgs/life/2020/00.jpg" >}}

At the same time, I prepared the oven to bake another 2 loaves worth of dough I had prepped the day before. The first loaf came out nicely, and I placed the second loaf in the oven. Within a few minutes, we smelled burning plastic and decided to check on the bread. In my rush to place the second loaf on the hot iron, I had accidentally placed the cutting board I scored the bread on into the oven with the bread! We realized this when seeing thick, goopy plastic dripping down to the bottom of the oven. 

We immediately took the bread out and started to scoop up the molten plastic with metal spatulas. As the plastic cooled, we removed the oven racks and the bottom panel of the oven and scrubbed them clean with a stainless steel scouring pad. The cast iron pan had a thick layer of plastic on it, so we put this in the deep freezer and later chiseled off the plastic in large chunks with a screwdriver and hammer. 

{{< figure src="/imgs/life/2020/00.jpg" caption="Chiseling the pan">}}

While the second loaf didn't have nearly enough time to bake properly in the large oven, we put it in the toaster oven with a mixing bowl on top in a desparate bid to save it. While the crust was abhorrent, the bread came out fairly ok!

{{< figure src="/imgs/life/2020/00.jpg" caption="Should be clear which one is which">}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/life/2020/00.jpg" caption="Bottom is the good loaf, has a more even crumb than the top!">}}

Also on Saturday and Sunday, we tried a new baking project: bagels! My brother loves bagels and I love finding ways to use my sourdough starter, so we settled on [this recipe for Sourdough New York style bagels][1] and got to work! We had to use the starter before it had peaked, and we messed up some of the waiting times, but through the rise, the fridge proof, the boiling, and the baking, we ended up with amazingly puffy bagels! When deciding what to top them with, we just looked through our pantry and settled on parmesan and pumpkin seeds as the only things that seemed appropriate on a bagel. They were so soft and tasty! Some bagels had parmesan on the bottom, which gave an amazing crunchy burnt cheese flavor.

### 05/18/20-05/25/20 (tenth week home)

All too soon, we had come to the last week of my brother's time at home. Starting in mid June, he will be returning to NYU to work as a first year resident. Once he starts work, it'll be tough for him to see Shriya due to his higher amount of exposure, so we planned to have him spend a couple weeks at her house with her family before residency. To minimize the risk he brings to them, we decided to take him via road trip; we and Shriya's family would each drive half way, and we'd hand him over somewhere in the middle of Ohio. 

To celebrate the last week, we walked our favorite walks, made our favorite foods, and watched for our favorite wildlife. On Monday, we saw a hawk struggling with what appeared to be a rope around its feet. As the hawk flew up from the lawn and landed on a branch, we saw the rope wriggle, and we realized the hawk had caught a snake! We took out the DSLR camera and got some pictures of the hawk taking the snake apart and eventually flying off, chased away by territorial robins with a nest on our deck.

On Tuesday, during our walk, we saw 5 deer in the trees! 

{{< figure src="/imgs/life/2020/00.jpg" >}}

Later on Tuesday, we went to see Sajel and Sanjana + family for a social distancing party so we could wish Anshu Chachi happy birthday. As part of this, I made my first offshoot of Chatsworth which hopefully they will keep alive.

{{< figure src="/imgs/life/2020/00.jpg" >}}

As part of our journey to drop off Keshav, we wouldn't feasibly be able to drive 20 hours straight, so we needed to plan some stops. Our schedule will look like this:

+ Thursday afternoon: drive 5 hours to an out-of-the-way hotel in Rockford, IL 
+ Friday morning: drive 5 hours to our extended family in Ann Arbor, MI and stay with them
+ Saturday morning: drive an hour to the meeting point and hand over Keshav, then drive back to Ann Arbor
+ Sunday night: drive 5 hours back to the Rockford hotel
+ Monday morning: drive 5 hours home

While making stops obviously adds risk, we decided that by disinfecting the hotel room and bringing our own beddings, we would minimize the risk of staying there. With our family visits in Ann Arbor, we've received some requests to try some of the many baked goods we've been making and sending pictures of, so on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, the three of us got to work. I made 4 loaves of bread and a batch of sourdough crackers, though due to issues with overproofing, none of the loafs were quite as good as I hoped. My brother and mom made a double batch of bagels, and by fixing the mistakes from the first batch, these turned out even puffier! This time, we used newly purchased "everything but bagel" seasoning to make 2/3s of the bagels into "everything bagels" and the remaining 1/3 into parmesan ones.

Also on Wednesday evening, Keshav had his offical graduation ceremony. Though he had already had the early ceremony in April, we were happy to celebrate and took the excuse to make carrot cake and a wonderful dinner spread.

{{< figure src="/imgs/life/2020/00.jpg" >}}

On Thursday, I did my remote work as usual while everyone else finalized preparations. We had a work AMA where they basically said we'll be working remotely for at least 3 months, but more likely 6+ months, but that's a problem to think about later. Soon as I was done and we got the rental car, we wiped down all the handles in the car, loaded up, and set off!

{{< figure src="/imgs/life/2020/00.jpg" caption="All loaded up!">}}

While we were hoping to avoid stops, around 2 hours into the drive, we had to stop for gas. I secretly had to pee, so I was glad, and we all took the opportunity for a bathroom break to avoid another stop later. The gas station convenience store was large, nearly empty, and had a staff member cleaning the doorknobs after each of us entered and exited! All in all, was much less stressful than expected. When we arrived at the hotel, we noticed the parking lot and building were both eerily empty, and there was a sign on the front desk requiring all guests to wear masks. We went to our room and wiped down all surfaces with clorox wipes before setting out beddings we had brought from home.

The next morning, we quickly packed up and started on the next 5 hour stint of our journey. We once again made a single stop for bathrooms, but again, things were surprisingly clean and well maintained. By early afternoon, we arrived at my mamaji's house! Right away, we showered and put aside our clothes from the trip. From then through Saturday afternoon, we relaxed and enjoyed time with our family there.

On Saturday, we drove around an hour and a half to a gas station where we met up with Shriya and her family. We chatted, ate, and finally said bye as we handed over my brother. Then we drove back. That night, we all watched Parasite, which was quite good!

The next day, after an early dinner, we packed up and said our goodbyes. The entire visit had been tinged with a sense of danger and guilt regarding the travel and interaction we had been so strongly resisting in Minnesota, but it was nice to have a change of pace and to see new people. Then, we were off again, on our way to the same hotel we had stayed at before.
