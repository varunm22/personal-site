### 03/06/20 (plant update)

Looks like the leaves of my stone plant have started to separate to reveal the new leaves underneath! I think these plants are actually supposed to produce one large flower each, which will be exciting to see in April or May.

### 03/06/20-03/08/20 (neha+boston)

This was a wonderfully relaxed weekend with time spent with neha and with my college friends. We had one date night where we walked for around an hour into Boston to the Italian restaurant Teatro. On our way back through Boston Commons, we saw what looked like two drunk men following closely behind and talking to an older woman walking through the park. We followed further behind them for a while to see if something concerning was happening, but at some point, they all went into a subway entrance and I made eye contact with the woman through the window. I gestured pointing at her to ask if she was ok, and I got an enthusiastic thumbs up, so we went our own way, taking a Lyft for the rest of the way back.

### 03/09/20-03/10/20 (anya in nyc)

My cousin Anya came with a friend to visit NYC for a couple days during her spring break, so I had them crash on my futon. While they were here, we met up with my brother and all went window shopping in Soho and got dinner and dessert. Our favorite store we went into was [Gentle Monster][1], which sold a variety of strange eyewear arranged around even stranger abstract moving sculptures. Dessert was strawberries and cream shaved ice at Bonsai Kakigori, one of my favorites which I had first tried in October.

### 03/11/20-03/15/20 (start of work from home)

Right around this time, work decided it was time for us to all start working from home due to the escalation of the covid-19 situation. Over the last week, due to the reduced focus on cybersecurity and the increased focus on getting people remote-ready, my personal workload had included more setting up devices for remote work, but now that I'm working from home, it's time to get back to my normal work. 

Work from home means I have a lot more time at home to put pent up energy into chores. In these first couple days, I cooked more quesadillas, more chole, and tried palak paneer for the first time! In addition, I did multiple loads of laundry, cleaned my floors, and organized my room.

During the working days themselves, I needed excuses for breaks during the day in absence of team chatter, so I got in the habit of daily short runs and meditation, the latter being inspired by [this video][1] (credit to Jess). Between the running, meditation, and having at least 1 of my roommates to hang out with, I wasn't feeling too cooped up for now.

Still, by the weekend, I felt a bit socially starved, so Anurag came over to chill and watch TV, then we decided to find a fancy bar for cocktails. We decided on Undercote, a fancy bar named as such because it exists in the basement of the restaurant Cote. The bar had an amazing ambiance with large wall fixtures filled with living plants. The drinks were unique and delicious; my first using catnip infused vodka and my second including color-changing butterfly pea flower dye.

The next day, I went to hang out at my brother's apartment, and we started to discuss whether we should head back to Minnesota, since the longer we waited, the more risky travel would be. I was hesitant as I wasn't sure yet if I could work remotely from Minnesota. After much discussion and a phone call with my boss's boss, we decided it was safest to just go, and I'd use vacation days and/or unpaid leave until the remote work situation could be resolved. At 10pm, we bought 6am tickets for the next morning, and I rushed home to get things packed.

### 03/16/20-??? (quarantine)

This represents the start of quarantine in Minnesota, which will be indicated as such by title, so the second half of March will be split into the next post.
