### 09/01/19

The start of the month brings the start of my new lease! Today, I saw my apartment for the first time, and over the next couple days, I started moving things in and getting set up. My apartment is quite small, but with high ceilings and decent features like strong air conditioning!

Once I got set up, I took a train to Boston to see Neha before starting work. We went to several of my favorite Boston restaurants including Spring Shabu Shabu, a hotpot restaurant with individual burners. I also took the opportunity to catch up with all the friends and family I still have in Boston.

Finally made it to my first week of work as part of the cybersecurity team at Jane Street. Some highlights among the whirlwind included this weird keyboard I started using and my first dessert buffet as a fulltime employee.

### 09/14/19

This weekend, I made plans to go to some street markets with coworkers. I found a wonderful blue cashmere quarterzip and a page with insect diagrams from an encyclopedia from a couple hundred years ago. The latter ended up in a frame as a wall decoration next to my desk.

### 09/23/19

I made seitan for the first time in my apartment. The texture turned out a bit tougher than I was hoping, but my soy sauce/cooking wine sauce turned out well.

During my summer South America trip, one dish that had eluded me was the Bolivian Salteña, which can be described as the empanada version of a soup dumpling. In Bolivia, we weren't able to find enough places which served vegetarian Salteñas, but in New York City, Bolivian Llama Party fulfilled my wish. This casual eatery is actually one of many built in an underground market attached to the Columbus Circle subway station. I highly recommend!
