### 01/01/20 (new year, newish? me)

New Year's day landed on a Wednesday, which is not the time of week for which I'm used to making plans. I started the year off with a fresh haircut while reaching out to friends to make plans. My next destination was The Bao, where I met with my brother, Shriya, Sachin, and Tara. I had eaten here Summer 2018 and highly enjoyed the crispy tofu I had eaten there, but I couldn't figure out what manu dish my friend had ordered for me that time. I showed the waiter a picture from back then (below), and he immediately recognized as the tofu variant of a chicken dish. I highly recommend this dish there!

My next destination was the Whitney Museum of American Art, where I met Sid and one of his friends from med school. This museum had a nice collection of modern art and was a bit more manageable in a day than the new MoMA.

### 01/21/20 (crepe cake!)

Today's dessert buffet was catered from Lady M, famous for their crepe cakes! This particular one was fantastic, having earl grey flavored cream between the layers of the 30 or so crepes.

### 01/25/20 (dumplings+sample sale)

In a celebration of Chinese New Year + friendship in general, I met up with Jeff and some other friends to make homemade dumplings. This was my first experience wrapping dumplings, and while I wasn't amazing at it, most of mine held together through cooking!

From here, I met up with Sid and a couple of his med school friends at 260 Sample Sale (conveniently a 10 minute walk away from Jeff's place) where a Bonobos sample sale was going on. This was my first time experiencing a sample sale, and there was a lot to be surprised by. Sample sales at this place are basically sales of excess merchandise from brands which switch out every week. The sample sale store itself was pretty starkly decorated, and instead of fitting rooms, there were just two curtained-off fitting areas, one for each gender. 

Bonobos clothes tend to be pretty expensive, but prices here were amazing with my favorite find being a 100% cashmere red/white waffle-knit sweater for $22. Overall, sample sales are awesome! Later that night, we met up with a few more of Sid's friends for drinks in K-town.

### 01/29/20 (hadestown)

Jane Street runs a lot of events for their interns, and they generally want a few fulltime employees to tag along and chat with the interns. As a result, I got free tickets to the Broadway show Hadestown! The cast, sets, and songs were awesome, and overall, this was one of my favorite theater shows I've ever seen.

### 01/31/20-02/02/20 (neha in nyc)

On our way home from Port Authority bus terminal, we took a detour to the stretch between 37th and 38th and Broadway. The night Neha arrived was the last night of an interactive art exhibit which filled the street with giant glowing seesaws. [Click here for Timeout article][1]

The next morning, we met up with my brother and Shriya for just about my favorite NYC brunch: chilaquiles and french toast at La Contenta! The next day, Neha and I decided to take Mexican food into our own hands with some home-cooked quesadillas with black beans and fresh veggies on corn tortillas. My original approach was to use two tortillas for each side of a round quesadilla. After much arguing, Neha convinced me to use one folded tortilla per quesadilla which ended up being much better.

Neha has been on the lookout for a succulent or cactus for her room, and I knew of some nice plant stores to take her to. Somehow, she convinced me that she didn't need one, but that I did, so meet my new plant!
