### 1/25/19
After work, we stocked up on food for the trip and packed lots of warm layers. We took our 2 hour flight, picked up our rental car, and drove 40 minutes to our Airbnb cabin in the middle of the countryside. As we drove through snowy and harrowingly narrow seaside roads, our eyes were glued to the bright myriad of stars dotting the pitch black skies. We saw a faint, yellowish-grey cloud which seemed a bit too narrow to be one, so I took a long exposure picture from the car window. The mild green glow arcing across the sky in the picture proved we had just seen our first Aurora Borealis (aka the northern lights)! 

Through the rest of the drive, we saw several more faint auroras, and couldn’t wait to get out of the car to a darker spot. Once we reached our cabin, we went to its dock overlooking the fjords and saw a much stronger aurora. 

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0111.jpg" caption="The Aurora Borealis" >}}

We drove further along the road until we found the first point where we could pull off the road and park. From here, we explored a very snowy hike up the mountain (until it got too snowy around 5 minutes in) and a path down the rocks to the edge of the water. We saw a few more mild auroras here, none as strong as the one by our cabin, but they looked nice with the stars given the lower light level. We came back to the cabin by around 2am and quickly fell asleep.

### 1/26/19
We woke up bright and early at around 8:15 and packed up our stuff for the day. Magnus and Allison left for an ice climbing tour at 9:30, so the other 4 of us walked around Storgata, Tromso’s primary shopping street. After getting some pastries from cafes, we found Tromso’s oldest sweater shop, and given our general sweater obsession, we had to go. They generally had the same nicer brands we had seen elsewhere, but I knew I wanted to buy a sweater at some point, it was REALLY cold in Tromso, and this place had a sale shelf. I found a beautiful sweater in just the colors I wanted from what seems to be the best company (Dale of Norway) and which fit me perfectly, so I bought it and checked off one more item from my Norway to-do list.

After this, we walked the Bruvegen bridge from the island Tromso resides on to the mainland. This area didn’t have too many restaurants or stores, but it did have Tromso’s most famous building, the Arctic Cathedral. Pictures describe this much better than my words would. We went inside to enjoy the architecture further while recovering from the traumatizingly cold walk across the bridge.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0118.jpg" caption="The Arctic Cathedral" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0119-0120.jpg" caption="View inside vs at the front" >}}

We stopped by one of the few nearby restaurants before heading to the base of the Tromso cable car, also on this side of the water. This cable car took us straight up a mountain, giving us an amazing few of all of Tromso just as night brought a deep blue glow to the sky. At the top, we took a few pictures at the lookout before retreating from the wind to the restaurant/cafe.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0125.jpg" caption="At the top" >}}

The building had another door leading out onto the snow atop the mountain, so we went out to explore, following a sign which appeared to be a trailhead. After getting a couple hundred feet out, we reached deeper snow which went well above the tops of our boots and realized the continuing tracks were from snowshoes. Given our lack of equipment and generally frozen faces, we were happy to head back and share waffles in the cafe. After a bit, we headed back down and walked back across the bridge to our pickup for our reindeer sledding tour (for me, Anna, and Yue).

The reindeer tour started after a half hour drive to a Sami camp. The Sami people are a more indigenous group which has inhabited Scandinavia for tens of thousands of years and which are heavily involved with reindeer herding. We started by each taking a bucket of food pellets and feeding a herd of reindeer. I was quite surprised by how docile and friendly they were, though I guess it was relatively similar to many petting zoo animals, The only frightening part of this experience was making sure the reindeer antlers didn’t poke your face while they pushed their way towards your food bucket. 

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0132.jpg" caption="Anna feeding the reindeer" >}}

After the feeding. we were led to our sleigh to sit down. Once our reindeer were set in place, the remainder of the herd suddenly stampeded away from the feeding area into the rest of their territory. We started on our sleigh ride. The ride itself was pretty slow and mildly underwhelming, but sitting on a sleigh while looking up at the stars was extremely calming. The reindeer and sleds were arranged so it went reindeer-sled-reindeer-sled-reindeer-sled, and the reindeer pulling the sled behind you was walking right next to you. This was pretty cool since i could just look over and see the reindeer walking around two feet to my right. 

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0135.jpg" caption="Playing out my dream of being Santa in a reindeer-pulled sleigh" >}}

After the reindeer ride, we ate dinner inside one of the Sami huts around a giant campfire. After this, we gathered in a smaller Sami hut and the Sami man who owned the herd told us about Sami culture and passed around various clothing and everyday items they used. During this, whenever there was an aurora, they’d call us out to watch. At one point, we saw by far the brightest aurora I had seen yet. I took several long exposure pictures which turned out beautiful, and multiple people on the tour had me send the pictures to them. 

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/northern-lights.gif" caption="Aurora + reindeer" >}}

We headed back relaxed, but very cold and tired, and met up again with Allison, Magnus, and Vlad. We then headed back to get to sleep. 

misc thoughts:
- my feet were absolutely frozen during the reindeer experience, so next time I go somewhere this cold, I should invest in proper wool socks
    - I put my feet close to the fire while we were warming up between auroras
    - one of the guides told us that a really good aurora started, so I started to put my shoes back on and realized the outer of my two polyester sock layers had actually melted away across a 2 inch patch. If I hadn’t had the other layer, there would be melted polyester stuck to my foot
- despite our great aurora today being an absolute beauty to experience in person, it was definitely less bright looking than the ones you see in pictures
    - basically every northern lights pic you see is a long exposure, which helps a lot
    - still worth seeing in person, but definitely have to temper expectations

### 1/27/19
We woke up at around 8 to get everything packed up from our Airbnb. On our way to the city, we first saw a reindeer just wander across the road into someone's yard. A little further down the road, we saw an otter jump out of the water and run across the road, holding some unidentified prey animal in its mouth. Our cabin's remote location certainly helped with viewing wildlife, as the listing had advertised.

We parked the car and headed to our pickup for our next tour: dog-sledding. We started off with an hour long bus ride towards the mainland to an area called Ramfjordbotn. Today was already significantly colder than yesterday (it was around 3F), and the temperatures tended to be around 10F colder further inland and away from the city. Accordingly, the people running the tour got us set up with nice boots, mittens, and full-body snowsuits.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0143.jpg" caption="Fully suited up" >}}

After getting fully dressed, we went out to the sleds and huskies and played with them while the guides got everything ready. Allison and I paired up, and I took the first turn driving. The sled had room for one person to sit on the wooden slats in front while the other stood on the back rails, pressing a foot break or using a foot to push forward as needed for downhill and uphill areas respectively.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0142.jpg" caption="Dogs waiting to go!" >}}

Early on in the run, our dogs were crazy. The front two would frequently look back at us, and the back ones liked to dive through the taller snow on the side of the trail. All of them were particularly good at pooping while running except for one which seemed to be suffering diarrhea. Our dogs were super loud and super fast, so we frequently had to stop to avoid running into the sled in front of us. Eventually, our dogs tired out and reached more of a normal pace, but they were still super loud and excited and silly.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0149.jpg" caption="From our point of view" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0150.jpg" caption="Action shot" >}}

Throughout the sled ride, we travelled through some of the most beautiful and strange landscapes I had ever seen. We alternated between dense, but leafless forests and vast snowy expanses. Surrounding us on all sides were gigantic, jagged mountains. The mountains, as with the rest of the landscape, were a pure untouched white, with their peaks tinged orange by the reflected sunlight. We never quite saw the sun itself, but as it sat beneath the mountain horizon, it lit the sky in a blue glow which contrasted perfectly with the orange mountain tops.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0146.jpg" caption="Surrounded by barely lit up mountains" >}}

We reached a beautiful lookout point and stopped to take pictures and give the dogs a break. At this point, we spent plenty more time playing with our dogs and giving them belly rubs before switching drivers and continuing. By the end of our 2 hours of dogsledding, my minimal facial hair was frosted with ice, and I couldn't feel my face, fingers, or toes. We headed inside to change, thaw, and eat.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0147.jpg" caption="Yue with her favorite husky" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0151.jpg" caption="Me with my favorite sweater" >}}

After arriving back at the city center, we were exhausted enough from the cold ride this morning that we just picked somewhere to eat relaxedly before heading early to the airport. On our way to the surprisingly good and cheap Thai restaurant we found, we stopped in a small art gallery to see what styles of art a Tromso life inspires. Things didn't seem too strange as far as local art galleries go, but paintings of green summer landscapes definitely made me want to come back and experience the stark difference myself.

After our one hour delayed flight, we had 20 minutes to kill while waiting for the train back to the city. This quickly devolved into chasing each other with snap bracelets, two of which we got from the car rental counter and once of which we found on the ground in Tromso. 

misc thoughts:
- coming into norway, I had 4 items on my checklist: fjords, skiing, northern lights, and obtaining sweater
- as of this point, i’ve confidently achieved all of them
- the only additional thing i’d really want to get out of this trip is to visit some museums to have more understanding of norwegian history, but i’ve hit the big things at least

### 1/28/19
After work, we stopped by the Oslo sweater store and Dale concept store to check out some sweaters for Allison. While she tried on several that she somewhat liked, she decided to come back later when the store owner could bring out more extra smalls. 

misc thoughts:
- if you’re trying to get a high quality norwegian sweater made in norway, dale seems to be the way to go
    - and if you’re getting a dale, the dale store has way better variety than the normal sweater shop

### 1/29/19 
Today was also mostly uneventful except another stop to the Dale sweater store with Allison, though Anna joined this time as well. While Allison was again unable to come to a decision, Anna unexpectedly fell in love with a sweater and resolved to buy it later (instead of now so she can make sure certain stuff with VAT refund works out).

### 1/30/19
After work today, Tyler hosted a DnD session at work! I had never played before, so I thought this would be a good opportunity to try. I made my character a wizard/entertainer named Frank, and together, we spent 3 hours escaping a very unfortunate dungeon. 

After work, we decided to have a weird youtube video marathon as our queue of weird youtube videos to show each other had been growing precipitously. This culminated with the 22 minute compilation of weekly “It’s Wendesday My Dudes” videos made by a dude named ZimoNitrome. I highly recommend watching this if anyone wants to experience a spiritual awakening. 

### 1/31/19
As I’ve reached basically endgame on my project, I didn’t really have much to do today, so I left by around 2:30pm. I had quite a productive afternoon though, as I picked up jello for jello shots, boxed wine, and stopped by the Dale sweater shop (AGAIN) to take pictures of a bunch of sweaters to potentially get my brother. After that, I did some dance practice stuff warmed up some food, and was wrapped in a blanket on the couch by the time everyone else came back. 

We spent the evening making plans for the weekend, and I started making the first round of jello shots. 

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0152.jpg" caption="Finally all sweatered up" >}}

### 2/1/19
Today was the last day of work! Morning was pretty relaxed until a new version of something got rolled out, and I frantically rushed around talking to people to try to get my demo to still work. We had our final presentations at our company all-hands meeting, where I showcased my internship work and briefly went through our weekend trips with my Norway checklist (fjords, skiing, northern lights, and sweater). 

Also, since today was the first day of the month, everyone’s lunch cards were refilled for the month. Since it’s our last day, we had 1500 NOK (~180 USD) on our cards that we had to spend in a day. During lunch, we went to the nice pizza restaurant in the lobby instead of the normal cafeteria and bought pizza for ourselves and friends. Then after work, I bought tons of chocolate, some Norwegian licorice, and a couple travel mugs. While all the wanton spending felt somewhat weird, at least it was certainly justified. Of course, Allison lost her card a few days ago, so her 1500 NOK was wasted...

After work, we went back to clean up our apartment and make the rest of the jello shots. The first few people showed up a bit after 8, and many more followed over the next couple hours. The party probably had around 20 people and polished off 2 liters of vodka (some of which was in jello shots (some of which hadn’t fully set, but were consumed regardless)), 3 liters of wine, and several beers. Apart from drinking, the party also featured a strangely large amount of arm wrestling and lots of lit music (beginning with the cognite playlist some interns made collectively). The last couple people finally cleared out at around 2am, and we fell quickly asleep, resolving to clean the enormous mess in the morning. 

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0153.jpg" caption="Finally throwing a rager" >}}

misc thoughts:
- lukas and magnus shared the greatest ever moment, but I can’t say what it is, but i’m putting down this bullet point just to remember it happened
    - additional reminder word: remember sauna conversation
- one of the biggest contributions I made to cognite outside my work had to be all my wonderful custom slack emojis
    - these started off with emojis built from other emojis (like the nested levels of parrot squares and the faces), but grew to include people and things from our daily life
    - magnus contributed several of the "thing" emojis that we all truly treasure including finger-in-cup, croissant-on-plate, open-bathroom-door, and intimate-touch. However, my most frequently used emoji in the cognite slack has to be metoothanks

### 2/2/19
I finally stumbled out of bed at around 11:30 am to a seemingly empty apartment. Sending a few messages was sufficient to find out that Lukas (who had crashed on our couch) and Magnus had gotten up at 10 and started the momentous cleanup. I (rightfully) assumed Allison was still completely passed out, and messaged out to see if people were still interested in going to the Viking Ship museum as we had previously planned. Julien and Anna joined Magnus and I, and Allison met up with us there once she finally arose. 

The Viking Ship museum was quite cool. It had several giant Viking ships and many artifacts which had been found in the burial mounds the ships were uncovered from. After we went through this, we took our bus back and stopped by the Historisk museum (which is included in the price of admission of the Viking Ship museum, and which is quite close to our place). We were tired enough to not last too long here, so we went back at a bit before 4 to scrounge together a late lunch and continue the apartment cleaning process. 

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0156.jpg" caption="A real Viking ship!" >}}

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0158.jpg" caption="Our version of 'me and the boys'" >}}

At around 6, we met with Lukas and went to the grocery store to get ingredients for tacos. Apparently, Norway is one of the consumers of tacos because taco night is a weekly tradition for a significant portion of the country. We couldn’t dream of leaving Norway without trying all the most important traditions, so hence, taco night. 

We were able to find a vegetarian pulled pork substitute, so with that, homemade-ish guac, hard and soft shells, and lots more, we enjoyed enough tacos to feel like we were ready to burst. After that, we digested while watching just about the trashiest show we could find (the proposal, look it up), then went to make nachos with leftover ingredients. 

When we had bought our taco ingredients, I also picked up a Kinder Surprise Egg. These consist of a chocolate egg that you break open and eat. The hollow cavity inside contains a plastic capsule with several plastic parts you can assemble into a toy. These are outlawed in the US because they are a food item which contains a non-food item, making them a choking hazard. The best part is, this law is actually strictly enforced, not only for the production of these eggs in the US, but also for just bringing them into the country, which is punishable by thousands of dollars of fines PER EGG. My illegal experience was both fun and tasty, as we assembled a weird legged top sort of thing.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0159.jpg" caption="Kinder surprise egg anatomy" >}}

We spent the rest of the evening until almost 2am enjoying each others' company in the stupidest of ways. As one example, Lukas believed all Asian people are lactose intolerant to some extent, a generalization to which Allison notably considers herself a counterexample. They decided to have a 1 minute milk chugging contest during which Lukas got through 4 cups and Allison 2. While Lukas technically won the contest, they had each consumed around the same amount by bodyweight. Also, if Julien or I drank 2 glasses of milk, we'd be shitting uncontrollably shortly after, so this counted as somewhat of a victory for Allison.

Another activity of note regarded the slap bracelets from Tromso. We discovered they could launch small pieces of food when they curl, so we created a multi-person catapult using one of the bracelets to shoot pieces of cucumber. One person would hold the non-launch end down as well as some point 2/3s of the way to the launch end. Another person put their finger above the bracelet by the launch end so when it snapped curled, the launch end would hit the finger to change the trajectory. After lots of optimization and dozens of trials, we finally succeeded in feeding Magnus.

Another not-quite-activity of note was THE TORTILLA. When we were making tacos, we briefly heated a stack of soft tortillas in the oven. The bottom one on the stack got pretty stiff, which only got worse as it sat alone and uneaten for at least an hour when we finished dinner. This tortilla enjoyed several unconventional uses including frisbee and hat. We took an action shot of the tortilla falling to use as a new slack emoji. The tortilla suffered the greatest loss in structural integrity when Allison interrupted a frisbee throw to Lukas and spiked the tortilla down at him.

At this point, I assumed the tale of the tortilla was over. Around 15 minutes later, while engrossed in some conversation, I suddenly felt a dull stabbing pain in my side. I looked over to see Allison had snuck up and stabbed me with the tortilla, now folded into a shape somewhat resembling a shank. While this was the last major event which involved the tortilla, it was not disposed of for an embarrassingly long time.

Finally, we said our long goodbyes and went to sleep, resolving to clean up the the new messes we had made in the morning.

misc thoughts:
- we had originally planned to do some barhopping tonight, but yesterday’s rager was more than enough to put that notion out of our heads
    - while we were surprised that literally every bit of anything alcoholic was seeked out and consumed the night before, we were kinda glad stuff got finished because we definitely weren’t drinking today

### 2/3/19
We woke up unfortunately early, finished rinsing the dishes, emptied the fridge, and made our way out. After getting our VAT refunds for our sweaters, going through security, and finding our gates, we said our drawn out goodbyes to each other. Finally, we split to fly back.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0160.jpg" caption="Last apartment squad picture" >}}

In my flight, I noticed our route took us over part of our ferry route from Gudvangen to Flam, so I took some airplane window pictures of the fjords. The fjords grew wider, the strips of land more narrow, and soon I found myself flying over scattered islands. The islands grew smaller and further apart until Norway and our time here finally came to an end.

When I decided to take this opportunity, my goals were to have adventures with Allison and Magnus, to get to know other interns and Norwegian people, and to feel like I really saw everything I could have seen while I was here. It was an exhausting 4 weeks, but we did it. I think I'm somewhat ready for the normalcy of my own bed and for a shower that doesn't flood the bathroom floor with every use, but I will miss Norway and all the adventures I had here.

misc thoughts:
- when I was first booking my tickets, I followed my usual approach of choosing a window seat next to several open seats in the hope that I may get an empty middle seat next to me
    - while booking, I realized this criterion happened to apply to relatively similar areas on each plane, so in the interest of unique experiences, I booked myself for seat 27A on all 4 flights
    - this really doesn’t matter, but it makes me happy
