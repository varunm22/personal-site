After returning from my South America trip, I had a couple weeks to relax and get prepped for my move to New York. My first weekend back, I went to Interstate state park with family and some extended family to go kayaking on the St. Croix river. This particular route involves spending around 2 hours kayaking 7 miles down calm water surrounded by beautiful foliage, rock cliffs, and occasional sand bars.
