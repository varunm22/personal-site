This IAP, I’m spending 4 weeks in Oslo, Norway doing software at the startup Cognite. I’ll be there with 2 other externs from MIT as well as 15-20 interns from the University of Waterloo who are here for 4 months.

### 1/5/19
I flew in this morning with a stopover in Iceland, then took a train into our apartment. The apartment has a huge common area, three bedrooms for the three of us, and a cute loft with an extra bed! I ran to 7-11 to pick up some stuff before coming back and falling asleep for a couple hours (red-eye international flights are usually restless). The next MIT extern, Allison, arrived at about this time, and we found a crepe place to eat at. This was somewhat of a struggle as food in Oslo is far more expensive than I expected. While cheap food exists, it’s definitely something we’ll have to search out. Accordingly, we stopped at a grocery store on the way back to pick up some essentials.

misc thoughts:
- some doors have random buttons to open them. If you don’t realize this, you may believe you are locked in a narrow hallway which contains a bathroom, but is outside a restaurant.
- sliced bread is cool and all, but have you ever used a machine at a grocery store to slice your bread in front of you literally right before you buy it?

### 1/6/19
After a somewhat restless and jetlagged night, we went by in the morning to join the Canadian interns. We walked through the Vigeland Sculptures in Frogner Park and took lots of fun pics with all the sculptures and the landscape. Overall, the sculptures and such felt a bit underwhelming, but the snowy landscape and unfortunately early sunset made for good pictures at least.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0009.jpg" caption="First meal!" >}}

We ventured out to find food, which was difficult given how many places close on Sunday, and eventually settled on something that felt vaguely like a Norwegian diner. Knowing Norway was not super vegetarian friendly, I came into this trip being okay with trying fish if need be. Today’s dinner turned out to be the first case of “need be” as the most vegetarian friendly option was salmon. While I was able to have a filling meal, it was very weird and definitely not something I am currently a fan of.

misc thoughts:
- Gustav Vigeland has a weird art style, and I kinda dig it, but was mildly disturbed. The monolith is very cool though.
- the MIT apartment has a wayyy bigger and nicer common area, so if anyone’s hosting a party, it’s def us
    - however, alc is nationalized and accordingly expensive and, so far, hard to find
    - also, waterloo interns are in a much more fun area
    - and there are way more of them together
    - and i think their setup is overall nicer, though I am grateful housing was found for me for the 4 weeks I am here
- karaoke bars are surprisingly cheap here (~$6.30 per person per hour on sunday-thurs, double price fri-sat) given how expensive everything else is, might want to hit one up

### 1/7/19
Today’s the first day of work! All in all, the actual day was pretty uneventful because it was mostly just presentations about what Cognite is and does as well as some presentations on what different teams here do. After we went back, the two other MIT externs went grocery shopping and I started figuring out the weekend’s trip logistics with Anna, a Waterloo intern. After figuring out an approximate (and unfortunately expensive) plan, we started cooking with our limited groceries from Sunday plus what Allison and Magnus brought back, but all we could do was bland, undersauced, whole wheat spaghetti. It was somewhat miserable, but it was at least something.

Before getting ready to sleep, Allison and I ranted to each other for a while about our annoyance with the food situation, which made me feel surprisingly better. We resolved to grocery shop better.

misc thoughts:
- Grocery store saga:
    - on saturday, we went to a small Kiwi grocery store and bought a few things, but the selection was pretty bad and stuff was expensive. on our way back, we found a grocery store that wasn’t on gmaps called Extra, and it looked huge, but we didn’t feel like carrying more, so we decided to come back tomorrow. allison referred to extra as “that target looking store”
    - on sunday, we went to extra, but since most stuff is closed on sunday, extra just had a tiny section open. unfortunately, we weren’t able to find anything we needed in this super limited selection
    - this morning, both allison and i realized we had dreamed about extra and its cornucopia of food just waiting. at least in my dream, it literally was target. unfortunately, when allison and magnus went today, they had inconsistent supply to the extent that they literally ran out of bread
    - the next option to check out is the giant kiwi grocery store by work, which seemed best, but we’d have to carry what we bought on the long and crowded bus ride back

### 1/8/19
Today, we started work with more presentations including some absolutely amazing demos. We followed this up with a workshop/hackathon which was the first opportunity to actually code during this internship. Afterwords, we played ping pong and had a catered mexican food dinner at work. Apparently, this company is intense enough at ping pong that they have an ELO ladder, so I definitely want to try making my mark. Dinner was awesome because it was in essentially unlimited quantities and pretty ok tasting. I ended up nabbing a catering tray with a mix of a bunch of stuff, so the next few dinners are now accounted for. We went grocery shopping anyways, and big Kiwi did not disappoint.

After coming back, we confirmed and booked plans for the first weekend: we’ll be going to Bergen (west of us) to see the most famous fjords of Norway. Given the two things I associated with Norway were fjords and northern lights, I’m glad I’ll be knocking one out this first weekend.

misc thoughts:
- it’s basically dark both when we arrive at and leave work, which is mildly depressing. someone in the canadian intern apartment got a full spectrum lamp which apparently helps reset your circadian rhythm and prevent winter depression
- now that sustenance is roughly covered, time to figure out more weekday plans and alc

### 1/9/19
Today was the first day we joined our teams at work! I’ve finally got set-up with an external keyboard with a US keyboard layout instead of the Norwegian layout my laptop has. I went through some tutorial stuff and got some idea of what I’ll be working on.

One thing that has been odd about Oslo is that we’ve hardly seen any real stores. Most stuff has been vaguely residential with the odd restaurant or grocery store here or there. Given the lack of Amazon use, I wondered how people got ordinary stuff. A full-timer had recommended a “general store” called Clas Ohlson we could visit, so we decided to go there today to get Allison a power adapter.

We took the bus a couple stops past our normal one and ended up in a totally different looking part of town. There were tall buildings and shops and restaurants everywhere! When we eventually found our way to Clas Ohlson, it had just about everything, it’s basically their Amazon.

misc thoughts:
- the area by clas ohlson seemed a lot more fun and lively than the more residential area by where we live, we may want to come back to there for food/bars

### 1/10/19
During our orientation, Maria (someone involved with organizing our internship) mentioned we could get certain group social events with coworkers covered, so we asked about karaoke. After getting her confirmation, we booked a room for tomorrow night! Every lit karaoke trip requires an equally lit pregame, so I looked up how buying alcohol here works.

APPARENTLY, like many things in Norway, alcohol is nationalized. Anything above 4.7% ABV is sold in state stores called Vinmonopolet (“wine monopoly”) where everything has a huge state tax on it and closes really early. Here, people will actually buy as much as they can from duty free because it’s that much cheaper.

After work, I rushed to a Vinmonopolet and got there at 5:58pm, 2 minutes before closing. I bought their cheapest vodka and cheapest boxed wine, which both ended up being almost exactly the same volume * abv / price.

Knowing tomorrow will be busy, I prepped some food for Bergen. In particular, I created an entity I shall thus refer to as the sandwich loaf: an entire loaf of vaguely round bread converted into a series of peanut butter and nutella sandwiches. The sandwich loaf is compact, non-perishable, somewhat ok tasting, and calorically magnificent.

misc thoughts
- the sun sets during working hours during norway winters, and it is fabulous when it does - the office has pretty big windows, so it’s pretty easy to catch this.

### 1/11/19
After work, a few interns congregated at our place for a short pregame before we headed to SYNG MER for our 6:45-8:45 booking. While the room was a bit cozy (cramped) for the 12 of us, the actual karaoke setup was awesome. Like the nicer places in NYC, SYNG MER had an electronic song selection and queue, but unlike anywhere else I’ve seen, they also had options to adjust the key and tempo of each song!

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0014-0015.jpg" caption="Karaoke in progress/weird baby statue at front" >}}

After karaoke, we stopped by a burger place called Max, which had some of the cheapest food we’ve seen so far, before heading back to our place to eat and hang out with everyone. At the end of our first successful apartment party, we slept relatively early in anticipation of Bergen.

I wasn’t sure whether to include this next part for today or tomorrow, but at 7:30 am, we got woken up by a very unfortunate fire alarm. We were only outside for a few minutes, but it was quite sad to be woken up early on the only day we can sleep in...

misc thoughts
- the karaoke place has a weird art piece in the window of a baby with a mic. i dig the aesthetic

### 1/12/19
We started our trip with a 7 hour trip from Oslo to Bergen on the Bergen Railway. We were specifically told to do this during daylight for the wonderful views, and they did not disappoint.


{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0018.jpg" caption="Mountains seen from the train window" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0019.jpg" caption="A stark, snowy landscape seen from the train window" >}}

Then we arrived in Bergen, and Bergen is beautiful. Even though it was dark and rainy, the shiny cobblestone streets were super pretty. In addition, part of the city is built up onto a mountain, and the lights of all the houses outline the shape of the mountain in the night. The diagonal string of lights in the upper left of that picture go along the Floibanen, a steeply inclined (26 degree incline) railway which people can use to travel along the mountain (we’ll come back to this).

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0023.jpg" caption="Bergen's city lights" >}}

Next, we went to our Airbnb to drop off our stuff. The apartment was super cute with super aesthetic lamps and the roundest fridge we’ve ever seen. Our host was also super nice (he lived upstairs) and he recommended we check out the Floibanen.

The train car itself was actually built shaped like a staircase to allow for people to sit on horizontal surfaces despite the steep incline. Also, once it started moving, the train movement felt more like a rollercoaster than a normal train. I had originally thought this was mainly a touristy thing used to take tourists to the lookout at the top, but the train actually stopped at intermediate points up the mountain to allow people to get out and go to where they lived.

{{< youtube dn1CHxUNvQ8 >}}

At the top, we took some cute pictures at a lookout before wandering around to kill the half hour we had until our trip back down. We came across a giant troll costume, and in the dense fog, it was legitimately scary. The presence of a playground and elementary school behind the statue certainly contributed. Interestingly, the use of flash generally made our pictures turn out worse because of how reflective the fog was.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0030.jpg" caption="A foggy and obviously haunted playground" >}}

As we continued to wander around, we found a signpost pointing out a couple trails and destinations. Most suspiciously, it had a sign which pointed to “THE LAKE” which appeared to be handwritten and was a different color than the others. For no good reason, we followed it into some of the darkest, foggiest, most ethereal woods I’ve ever seen.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0031.jpg" caption="A foreboding entrance - note the sign for \"THE LAKE\"" >}}

As we walked through the trees with inconsistent lamp posts, we came across assorted signs. The first said “PLEASE DON’T WAKE THE BABY DINOSAURS”. With the original troll statue being next to a playground, this playful sign felt slightly more sinister. The only picture I got is incredibly hard to read as the sign was far from a lamp post and flash was blocked by the increasingly dense fog. The second sign we came across was in Norwegian, so Magnus used Google Translate to see what it said. What we got was something like “Don’t sit here when all hope is gone”. Needless to say, none of us sat in the bench immediately in front of the sign.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0032_.jpg" caption="The two signs we came across - it was impossible to get a better picture of the first sign because it was too far from any of the streetlamps, and flash reflected off the fog as shown" >}}

Finally, we made it to “THE LAKE”. There wasn’t really a lamp post nearby, so the only present illumination was what appeared to be a floating green light somewhere further down along the shore. With how dense the fog was, my picture with flash was useless, and without flash, I had to use a half second exposure just to see anything. After documenting the scene, we rushed all the way back and onto the train car just in time to head back down.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0032_5.jpg" caption="The lake without and with flash. This area was dark enough for even that first picture to require a 10 second shutter speed" >}}

After being traumatized by the most surreal and horror movie-esque experience of my thus short life, we walked back through some wholesome cobblestone streets on our way back home. We ended the night by watching Blink (a famously scary Doctor Who episode) and cooking some tortellini to take with us tomorrow.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0033.jpg" caption="After surviving the troll forest" >}}

misc thoughts
- i’d always felt horror movies were super unrealistic because people are always using their phone cameras to document stuff on social media. here though, i literally just couldn’t take a quality picture, and this fact was deeply disturbing
- we asked lukas (started at Cognite w/ us, he’s actually norwegian tho, so he’s our token local) what the scary sign (“Don’t sit here when all hope is gone”) translated to, and he said “Don’t sit inside when all hope is outside”, which is significantly more positive, but of course we’re going to take the negative interpretation when we’re in that cursed place

### 1/13/19
Today started with 1.5 hours back on our initial train towards Oslo, but we got off at somewhere called Voss. Here, we caught a bus, which officially started our self-guided Norway in a Nutshell tour. This bus ride started us going through a relatively wide, “U-shaped” valley with pristine winter landscapes, distant mountains, and wonderfully yellow and red houses. At some point, we passed through a long stone tunnel and emerged into a much more narry, “V-shaped” valley lined with 4000 foot tall mountains. Our driver informed us that this site had achieved UNESCO World Heritage status, like many of the places we would visit today.


{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0034.jpg" caption="Red houses in the snowy hills" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0036.jpg" caption="A dark forest" >}}

The bus ride ended at Gudvangen, a 60 person town which a million tourists pass through every year. Thankfully, we came at the height of the off-season so the town was relatively empty. Gudvangen is at one end of the famous Nærøyfjord. Fjords in general are roughly tree shaped, and the large fjord we’re in is Sognefjord. Nærøyfjord specifically refers to the section of it which includes a branching point and the two branches which end at the towns Gudvangen and Flam. Our boat tour would take us from one to the other.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0039.jpg"  >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0042.jpg" caption="Facing out into the fjord" >}}


Gudvangen itself was incredibly gorgeous with the end of the fjord enclosed in mountains. The water itself was bright green, crystal clear, and filled with red and orange starfish. After enjoying a pastry at a cafe here, we started our ferry ride.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0040.jpg" caption="Starfish in the blue-green fjord water" >}}

This ferry ride was without a doubt, the most beautiful ride in any vehicle I have taken in my entire life. The boat was at around 10% capacity, so we had no trouble getting unobstructed views from any part. While it was extremely cold and windy, we spent as much time as possible on the outdoor deck instead of the heated inside area, but we definitely had to take occasional breaks to defrost.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0067.jpg" caption="FJORDS" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0065.jpg" caption="FJORD village" >}}

We ended the ferry in Flam. We stopped first to buy pastries at a cafe there, and these were some of the largest and best pastries I’ve ever had. I personally got a piece of brioche, but the others’ cinnamon bun and chocolate croissant were both amazing too. We then went to a random shop and I found the most Norwegian sweater I’ve ever seen. It was unfortunately a bit more than I was willing to spend, but I’m just glad I was able to experience its existence.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0048.jpg" caption="Arrival into Flam" >}}
{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0052.jpg" caption="Flam sweater" >}}

The next part of our journey was a ride on the Flam railway, one of the most famously picturesque railways in Europe. This track maintains about a 6 degree elevation angle through its 1 hour journey to Myrdal, another stop on the Oslo -> Bergen railway. The train wove through the mountains around Flam and the fjord and gave us plenty more fantastic views. The train itself also had a very old-fashioned look on the inside which definitely contributed to the ambiance. We stopped next to a frozen waterfall for pictures, and the four of us threw snowballs at it. There was also a troll statue here, which made us feel unfortunately triggered.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0178.jpg" caption="Sitting outside the final trainstop" >}}

At Myrdal, we caught a train which took us to Bergen, then we flew back to Oslo and slept very soon after we got home.
