During this January, I spent 4 weeks interning at the startup Cognite alongside 2 other students from MIT and several students from Waterloo. During this time, we experienced fjords, cross-country skiing, northern lights, and more. This post will focus on summarizing our weekend travel and weekday exploration of Oslo (vs the last 3 posts which detail my thoughts on life, work, and travel collectively).

### 1/6/19
We took things slow our first weekend in as we adjusted to jetlag and got set up in our apartment. On Ssunday, we walked through the Vigeland Sculptures in Frogner Park and took lots of fun pics with all the sculptures and the landscape. Overall, the sculptures and such felt a bit underwhelming, but the snowy landscape and unfortunately early sunset made for good pictures at least.

### 1/11/19
After work, a few interns congregated at our place for a short pregame before we headed to SYNG MER for our 6:45-8:45 booking. While the room was a bit cozy (cramped) for the 12 of us, the actual karaoke setup was awesome. Like the nicer places in NYC, SYNG MER had an electronic song selection and queue, but unlike anywhere else I’ve seen, they also had options to adjust the key and tempo of each song! The place also had a weird baby statue up front, which really played to absolutely nobody's sense of aesthetic.

### 1/12/19-1/13/19
For our first full weekend in Norway, we decided to visit Norway's famous fjords near the town of Bergen. We started our trip with a 7 hour trip from Oslo to Bergen on the Bergen Railway. We were specifically told to do this during daylight for the wonderful views, and they did not disappoint.

Then we arrived in Bergen. Though it was dark and rainy, the city's cobblestone streets and colorful houses were charming in the glow of the streetlights. We quickly noticed that part of the city was built up onto a mountain, which was dotted with houselights and the lights of the Floibanen (the diagonal string of white lights in the picture below), a steeply inclined (26 degree incline) railway used as public transit to various points up the mountain. After dropping our things off at our Airbnb, we took the Floibanen up the mountain.

Due to the steep incline, the train car itself was actually built shaped like a staircase to allow for people to sit on horizontal surfaces. Also due to the incline, once the train car started moving, its movement felt more like a rollercoaster than that of a normal train. I initially assumed that the Floibanen served primarily as a tourist attraction and as a means towards a view, though I quickly realized this was actually a vital form of public transportation which took people to homes located at various points along our way.

TODO: EDIT STARTING HERE!!!

At the top, we took some cute pictures at a lookout before wandering around to kill the half hour we had until our trip back down. We came across a giant troll costume, and in the dense fog, it was legitimately scary. The presence of a playground and elementary school behind the statue certainly contributed. Interestingly, the use of flash generally made our pictures turn out worse because of how reflective the fog was.

As we continued to wander around, we found a signpost pointing out a couple trails and destinations. Most suspiciously, it had a sign which pointed to “THE LAKE” which appeared to be handwritten and was a different color than the others. For no good reason, we followed it into some of the darkest, foggiest, most ethereal woods I’ve ever seen.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0031.jpg" caption="A foreboding entrance - note the sign for \"THE LAKE\"" >}}

As we walked through the trees with inconsistent lamp posts, we came across assorted signs. The first said “PLEASE DON’T WAKE THE BABY DINOSAURS”. With the original troll statue being next to a playground, this playful sign felt slightly more sinister. The only picture I got is incredibly hard to read as the sign was far from a lamp post and flash was blocked by the increasingly dense fog. The second sign we came across was in Norwegian, so Magnus used Google Translate to see what it said. What we got was something like “Don’t sit here when all hope is gone”. Needless to say, none of us sat in the bench immediately in front of the sign.

{{< figure src="/imgs/norway/0032_.jpg" caption="The two signs we came across - it was impossible to get a better picture of the first sign because it was too far from any of the streetlamps, and flash reflected off the fog as shown" >}}

Finally, we made it to “THE LAKE”. There wasn’t really a lamp post nearby, so the only present illumination was what appeared to be a floating green light somewhere further down along the shore. With how dense the fog was, my picture with flash was useless, and without flash, I had to use a half second exposure just to see anything. After documenting the scene, we rushed all the way back and onto the train car just in time to head back down.

After being traumatized by the most surreal and horror movie-esque experience of my thus short life, we walked back through some wholesome cobblestone streets on our way back home. We ended the night by watching Blink (a famously scary Doctor Who episode) and cooking some tortellini to take with us tomorrow.

misc thoughts
- i’d always felt horror movies were super unrealistic because people are always using their phone cameras to document stuff on social media. here though, i literally just couldn’t take a quality picture, and this fact was deeply disturbing
- we asked lukas (started at Cognite w/ us, he’s actually norwegian tho, so he’s our token local) what the scary sign (“Don’t sit here when all hope is gone”) translated to, and he said “Don’t sit inside when all hope is outside”, which is significantly more positive, but of course we’re going to take the negative interpretation when we’re in that cursed place
