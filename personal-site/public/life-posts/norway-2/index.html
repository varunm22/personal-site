    <h3 id="11419">1/14/19</h3>
<p>At work today, we looked up the mysterious forest from the mountain in Bergen. Apparently, it’s called the Troll Forest, and is something that little kids can explore during bright and sunny day. I still would like to defend our fear with the fact that any forest is going to seem scary at night and doubly so when fog reduces your visibility even with a flashlight to 10-15 feet. In addition, the forest apparently has small troll statues in it. I’m somewhat glad the fog was there because if we happened to spot a tiny troll silhouette, I’m pretty sure one of us would’ve pissed our pants.</p>
<p>After work, Lukas, Anna, and Julien (another Waterloo intern) came over and we chilled while watching Mean Girls. Since all of us except Julien had seen it, we first tried to watch Mean Girls 2, but it was so bad, we switched back to the original within a couple minutes.</p>
<h3 id="11519">1/15/19</h3>
<p>Today was pretty chill. For the first time, we saw a pretty nice sunrise during our walk to work! After work, we mostly just chilled and discussed the upcoming weekend.</p>
<h3 id="11619">1/16/19</h3>
<p>Today was another pretty chill day at work. My mentor mentioned he’d be gone tomorrow to visit a large shipping boat to install some cognite equipment and asked if I wanted to join. Of course I said yes, so tomorrow, I’m going to a port outside Gothenburg, Sweden!</p>
<h3 id="11719">1/17/19</h3>
<p>One of the fulltimers coming to Sweden picked me up at my place a bit after 7am, and we were on our way. I enjoyed the scenery until just after we passed the border into Sweden an hour and a half into the drive, then was fast asleep for the remaining hour and a half. On the ship, we started by going to the ship’s bridge. I’ve never seen the bridge of a large ship, so this reminded me first of the ship in Star Trek before reminding me of any actual boat.</p>

</p>
<p>We worked with the captain and some crew members on our installation before joining them for food in the ship’s galley. Since the crew and shipping company are Korean, they actually had some Korean noodles which tasted vaguely like bibimbap sauce, but spicier. This was the first good spicy food I’ve had this IAP!</p>
<p>After lunch, we drove 3 hours back, most of which I was asleep for. After getting back and slowly waking up, Allison, Magnus, Anna, Nick, and Lukas came over so we could go to some bars. Given how Friday evenings are good for packing and/or leaving for weekend trips, Thursday seemed like the best bet to explore Oslo nightlife.</p>

<p>The first bar we went into was literally empty (which makes sense given it was 9pm on a Thursday, but still). We heard the student bar at the University of Oslo was a bit busier, so we took the train over, wandered drunkenly through the extremely beautiful business school, and finally ended up at our target. The bar was perfectly collegiate, with a ping pong table, a beer pong table, and suitably cheap cocktails.</p>

</p>
<p>After some games, drinks, and dancing, we decided to head back, given we still had work the next day. In the train, we struck up conversation with a French girl and Russian guy and discussed life in Norway and weird US politics. The night ended with a McDonald’s trip (which had surprisingly cheap veggie burgers) and some apartment conversation.</p>
<h3 id="11819">1/18/19</h3>
<p>After work today, I decided to figure out what I’d be doing this weekend. While I could normally rely at least on the Bergen squad, Allison and Magnus are in a group of 5 headed in a rental car 3 hours away to a downhill ski resort, and Anna is headed to London for a hackathon. I can’t do downhill skiing because of my back, but I still want to try cross country skiing, as it seems to be the most popular sport in Norway. Oslo is well known to have amazing cross country skiing close to the city, so I spent the night chilling and looking up ski routes. Tyler and Julien agreed to join!</p>
<h3 id="11919">1/19/19</h3>
<p>Today, we created a multi-step plan to help track our day’s progress.</p>
<h4 id="step-1-meet">Step 1: Meet</h4>
<p>We had a somewhat chaotic series of miscommunications which involved walking in circles and going between multiple train stations, but finally at around 11, we made it to our target platform all together.</p>
<h4 id="step-2-find-the-ski-lodge-and-step-3-successfully-rent-skis">Step 2: Find the ski lodge (and Step 3: Successfully rent skis)</h4>
<p>We accidentally got off one step too late, but after a slightly longer than planned walk (20 instead of 15 minutes) and some walking down the edge of skiing bunny hills, we finally found ski rental. Ski rental was surprisingly painless, and we soon headed out to walk to the start point of several beginner trails. We rented the skis for 2 days so we can more easily come back tomorrow!</p>
<h4 id="step-4-find-a-target-destination-and-step-5-hopefully-reach-it">Step 4: Find a target destination (and Step 5: Hopefully reach it?)</h4>
<p>We found a lodge that didn’t seem too far away and which was accessible via a “beginner-friendly” path, so we set off. Without paying too much attention to our paper map, we quickly got lost. While I got somewhat of a hang of skiing on perfectly level ground, I started to struggle once we came across some tiny hills (5-10 feet long, maybe 2 feet tall?). I could push my way up, but on literally every downhill segment, I fell right back on my butt. This wasn’t too bad for these tiny slopes, but as part of our horrendous navigation, we came to some larger slopes. On some of these, I fell at least 5 times, making me easily the worst skier in our group of 3. Finally, I realized I hadn’t been able to easily “pizza” my way down because my boots were too loose, so I tightened them and had much less trouble moving forward.</p>

<p>Finally, we got to the lodge and stopped for cinnamon buns and food. We took a quick bathroom break before deciding to actually follow the easy route back to the start.</p>

<p>Step 6: Find our way back to where we started
Now that we actually had an easy to follow and easy to ski route back to the start, we didn’t have too much trouble making progress. As we approached our start point, we decided to continue further along the easy path to its conclusion at the train station Midstuen. Midstuen was on the same line as our original station, but several more stops in the direction of home.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While the path (initially) remained easy to ski, it certainly didn’t remain easy to follow. There were several splits that we tried to navigate using Google Maps, but we ended up at an extremely icy slope which appeared to end with a red rope blocking our way. Past the red rope, extremely athletic looking people were in the middle of a very intense skiing race. As we initially tried to descend this, both Julien and I fell, but Julien’s fall caused one of his poles to snap in half. From here, every path seemed to be pretty heavily sloped up or down, so we walked up to what appeared to be a road that could lead us to Midstuen.</p>

</figure>

<p>The walk to Midstuen was also somewhat unfortunate, being around 30 minutes long and steeply downhill sloping. The end portion of it actually just became a famous sledding hill which was used in the Olympics sometime in the 50s. We finally reached the station and took the train back up to where we rented our skis so Julien could purchase a replacement. We got to the rental counter at 4:50 pm, 10 minutes before closing</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Step 7: Make our way home
Tired, sore, and somewhat defeated, we nevertheless enjoyed our long, sedentary ride back. Due to our 2-day rental, the walk back to our respective apartments unfortunately involved grappling with skis and poles. After individually recovering, we planned a better route for tomorrow.</p>
<p>1/20/19
After yesterday’s mishaps, we optimized for our mistakes and formulated a new multi-step plan.</p>
<p>Step 1: Get out of bed
Every part of my arms and legs hurt either from the labor they had been put through or the falls they cushioned. While getting up was a formidable challenge, we still met at the train station by around 9:30, significantly earlier than the previous day.</p>
<p>Step 2: Get to the start of the trail
This time, we intentionally went to the last stop on the train (Frognerseteren) as our trail started right around there, we generally followed a large group of people skiing along a path until we reached a collection of signs. Once pointed out our next stop Skjennungstua as 4.5 km away, so we started on our way.</p>
<p>Step 3: Get to Skjennungstua
As we went along the trail, we had a much better general sense of navigation, but there were still some confusing branch points. On a couple occasions, we asked some people which way was best to Skjennungstua. After our butchered pronunciation clearly wasn’t communication our destination, we used our phones to show the word itself. The usual response we got was something like “Well, you could go this way to Skjennungstua, and you can take that path”.</p>
<p>Following their instructions took us down several steep downhill slopes, many of which I fell on. With one of these falls, a couple experienced looking skiers on their way up the hill stopped to ask if I was ok. The dialogue was as such:</p>
<p>Them: “Are you ok?”
Me: “Yeah, I tried this for the first time yesterday, and I don’t think I’ve improved that much since”
Them: “You just started? This is a very steep hill”
Me: “Yeah, I’ve realized that.”
Them: “Well, are you at least having fun?”
Me: “SOMETIMES”</p>
<p>I eventually made it down in one piece, and we enjoyed some flatter skiing for a while. Then at some point, we found signs stating we were around a kilometer away, and this is when things got rough. The remaining portion of the trail grew steeper and steeper uphill almost continuously. While I wasn’t as inclined to fall when going uphill compared to downhill, I fell once in a while due to sheer exhaustion.</p>

<p>Finally, we made it to the top to Skjennungstua. We were on top of a mountain, and the views most certainly made that clear. This stop, which contained one of the many ski lodges dotting the park, is particularly known for good fresh cakes and other desserts, a fact we took full advantage of. As we sat outside on a table, sipping hot chocolate and nibbling first on bread with butter and brown cheese, then on cakes, we watched the two trails leading to the lodge.</p>

</p>
<p>Our trail was nearly abandoned producing just a couple skiers within the half hour. The other trail, however, was streaming in skiers of all ages and sizes, including kids who couldn’t have been older than 4. This was when we realized why everyone was surprised about our path to Skjennungstua: it worked, but there existed a path without the scarily steep downhill and exhaustingly steep uphill to follow; we just were too navigationally challenged to find it.</p>
<p>Step 4: Get to Ullevålseter
Given our top-of-the-mountain status, the next 2.2 km section was quite quick, though frighteningly downhill at parts. Within half an hour, we had made it to Ullevålseter. After our lengthy break at our last stop, we just stopped by the bathroom and moved on.</p>
<p>Step 5: Get to Sognsvann
After seeing a sign indicating 6.5 km to Sognsvann, I was mentally prepared for the worst. However, this path was generally quite level; our greatest concern was trying to navigate the path among the surprisingly dense crowds. The only fall I suffered here was when I swerved to avoid a toddler, getting in the path of someone else much faster doing the same. He avoided me, but i freaked out and fell. Julien, who was unfortunately behind me, also suffered the same fate.</p>
<p>Overall, we ended up making it to Sognsvann in just about an hour. Total, we had gone around 13 km and spent around 3.5 hours including the half hour break at Skjennungstua.</p>
<p>Sognsvann itself referred to large frozen lake next to our destination train station. We walked across its surface to an island in the middle where a family was having a campfire. After exploring, we headed to the station.</p>

</p>
<p>Step 6: Maneuver the train transfer (and Step 7: Get off the train and Step 8: Return the skis and Step 9: Get home alive)
The Sognsvann stop was at the end of the 5 train line, and we needed to get to the end of the 1 train line, so we enjoyed a 20 minute ride back to the city and 30 minute ride back out to Tryvann. While this felt wonderful, standing up at the end was a struggle.</p>
<p>Returning the skis was pretty uneventful, and soon we were on our way home. Shortly after, Allison and Magnus returned from Hemsedal, and we, along with Julien and Lukas, watched Trollhunter, a Norwegian mocumentary about a guy who hunts trolls. This was especially entertaining in the context of our last weekend Bergen trip as the movie visited similar places and the trolls resembled the ones which had terrified us in the forest.</p>
