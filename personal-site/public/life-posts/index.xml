         <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;11419&#34;&gt;1/14/19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work today, we looked up the mysterious forest from the mountain in Bergen. Apparently, it’s called the Troll Forest, and is something that little kids can explore during bright and sunny day. I still would like to defend our fear with the fact that any forest is going to seem scary at night and doubly so when fog reduces your visibility even with a flashlight to 10-15 feet. In addition, the forest apparently has small troll statues in it. I’m somewhat glad the fog was there because if we happened to spot a tiny troll silhouette, I’m pretty sure one of us would’ve pissed our pants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After work, Lukas, Anna, and Julien (another Waterloo intern) came over and we chilled while watching Mean Girls. Since all of us except Julien had seen it, we first tried to watch Mean Girls 2, but it was so bad, we switched back to the original within a couple minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;11519&#34;&gt;1/15/19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was pretty chill. For the first time, we saw a pretty nice sunrise during our walk to work! After work, we mostly just chilled and discussed the upcoming weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;11619&#34;&gt;1/16/19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was another pretty chill day at work. My mentor mentioned he’d be gone tomorrow to visit a large shipping boat to install some cognite equipment and asked if I wanted to join. Of course I said yes, so tomorrow, I’m going to a port outside Gothenburg, Sweden!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;11719&#34;&gt;1/17/19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the fulltimers coming to Sweden picked me up at my place a bit after 7am, and we were on our way. I enjoyed the scenery until just after we passed the border into Sweden an hour and a half into the drive, then was fast asleep for the remaining hour and a half. On the ship, we started by going to the ship’s bridge. I’ve never seen the bridge of a large ship, so this reminded me first of the ship in Star Trek before reminding me of any actual boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.example.org/imgs/norway/0079.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;The giant ship&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The giant ship&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.example.org/imgs/norway/0080.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;The bridge&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bridge&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We worked with the captain and some crew members on our installation before joining them for food in the ship’s galley. Since the crew and shipping company are Korean, they actually had some Korean noodles which tasted vaguely like bibimbap sauce, but spicier. This was the first good spicy food I’ve had this IAP!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch, we drove 3 hours back, most of which I was asleep for. After getting back and slowly waking up, Allison, Magnus, Anna, Nick, and Lukas came over so we could go to some bars. Given how Friday evenings are good for packing and/or leaving for weekend trips, Thursday seemed like the best bet to explore Oslo nightlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.example.org/imgs/norway/0081.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;Pre-gamed and ready to go!&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pre-gamed and ready to go!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first bar we went into was literally empty (which makes sense given it was 9pm on a Thursday, but still). We heard the student bar at the University of Oslo was a bit busier, so we took the train over, wandered drunkenly through the extremely beautiful business school, and finally ended up at our target. The bar was perfectly collegiate, with a ping pong table, a beer pong table, and suitably cheap cocktails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some games, drinks, and dancing, we decided to head back, given we still had work the next day. In the train, we struck up conversation with a French girl and Russian guy and discussed life in Norway and weird US politics. The night ended with a McDonald’s trip (which had surprisingly cheap veggie burgers) and some apartment conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;11819&#34;&gt;1/18/19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After work today, I decided to figure out what I’d be doing this weekend. While I could normally rely at least on the Bergen squad, Allison and Magnus are in a group of 5 headed in a rental car 3 hours away to a downhill ski resort, and Anna is headed to London for a hackathon. I can’t do downhill skiing because of my back, but I still want to try cross country skiing, as it seems to be the most popular sport in Norway. Oslo is well known to have amazing cross country skiing close to the city, so I spent the night chilling and looking up ski routes. Tyler and Julien agreed to join!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;11919&#34;&gt;1/19/19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we created a multi-step plan to help track our day’s progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-1-meet&#34;&gt;Step 1: Meet&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a somewhat chaotic series of miscommunications which involved walking in circles and going between multiple train stations, but finally at around 11, we made it to our target platform all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-2-find-the-ski-lodge-and-step-3-successfully-rent-skis&#34;&gt;Step 2: Find the ski lodge (and Step 3: Successfully rent skis)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We accidentally got off one step too late, but after a slightly longer than planned walk (20 instead of 15 minutes) and some walking down the edge of skiing bunny hills, we finally found ski rental. Ski rental was surprisingly painless, and we soon headed out to walk to the start point of several beginner trails. We rented the skis for 2 days so we can more easily come back tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-4-find-a-target-destination-and-step-5-hopefully-reach-it&#34;&gt;Step 4: Find a target destination (and Step 5: Hopefully reach it?)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found a lodge that didn’t seem too far away and which was accessible via a “beginner-friendly” path, so we set off. Without paying too much attention to our paper map, we quickly got lost. While I got somewhat of a hang of skiing on perfectly level ground, I started to struggle once we came across some tiny hills (5-10 feet long, maybe 2 feet tall?). I could push my way up, but on literally every downhill segment, I fell right back on my butt. This wasn’t too bad for these tiny slopes, but as part of our horrendous navigation, we came to some larger slopes. On some of these, I fell at least 5 times, making me easily the worst skier in our group of 3. Finally, I realized I hadn’t been able to easily “pizza” my way down because my boots were too loose, so I tightened them and had much less trouble moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.example.org/imgs/norway/0085.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;Tyler leading the way&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tyler leading the way&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we got to the lodge and stopped for cinnamon buns and food. We took a quick bathroom break before deciding to actually follow the easy route back to the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.example.org/imgs/norway/0086.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;Break at the lodge&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Break at the lodge&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 6: Find our way back to where we started
Now that we actually had an easy to follow and easy to ski route back to the start, we didn’t have too much trouble making progress. As we approached our start point, we decided to continue further along the easy path to its conclusion at the train station Midstuen. Midstuen was on the same line as our original station, but several more stops in the direction of home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.example.org/imgs/norway/0087.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;On our way again!&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;On our way again!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the path (initially) remained easy to ski, it certainly didn’t remain easy to follow. There were several splits that we tried to navigate using Google Maps, but we ended up at an extremely icy slope which appeared to end with a red rope blocking our way. Past the red rope, extremely athletic looking people were in the middle of a very intense skiing race. As we initially tried to descend this, both Julien and I fell, but Julien’s fall caused one of his poles to snap in half. From here, every path seemed to be pretty heavily sloped up or down, so we walked up to what appeared to be a road that could lead us to Midstuen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.example.org/imgs/norway/0088.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;View from the hills&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;View from the hills&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The walk to Midstuen was also somewhat unfortunate, being around 30 minutes long and steeply downhill sloping. The end portion of it actually just became a famous sledding hill which was used in the Olympics sometime in the 50s. We finally reached the station and took the train back up to where we rented our skis so Julien could purchase a replacement. We got to the rental counter at 4:50 pm, 10 minutes before closing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.example.org/imgs/norway/0090.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;Sunset along our final walk&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sunset along our final walk&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 7: Make our way home
Tired, sore, and somewhat defeated, we nevertheless enjoyed our long, sedentary ride back. Due to our 2-day rental, the walk back to our respective apartments unfortunately involved grappling with skis and poles. After individually recovering, we planned a better route for tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/20/19
After yesterday’s mishaps, we optimized for our mistakes and formulated a new multi-step plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Get out of bed
Every part of my arms and legs hurt either from the labor they had been put through or the falls they cushioned. While getting up was a formidable challenge, we still met at the train station by around 9:30, significantly earlier than the previous day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Get to the start of the trail
This time, we intentionally went to the last stop on the train (Frognerseteren) as our trail started right around there, we generally followed a large group of people skiing along a path until we reached a collection of signs. Once pointed out our next stop Skjennungstua as 4.5 km away, so we started on our way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Get to Skjennungstua
As we went along the trail, we had a much better general sense of navigation, but there were still some confusing branch points. On a couple occasions, we asked some people which way was best to Skjennungstua. After our butchered pronunciation clearly wasn’t communication our destination, we used our phones to show the word itself. The usual response we got was something like “Well, you could go this way to Skjennungstua, and you can take that path”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following their instructions took us down several steep downhill slopes, many of which I fell on. With one of these falls, a couple experienced looking skiers on their way up the hill stopped to ask if I was ok. The dialogue was as such:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Them: “Are you ok?”
Me: “Yeah, I tried this for the first time yesterday, and I don’t think I’ve improved that much since”
Them: “You just started? This is a very steep hill”
Me: “Yeah, I’ve realized that.”
Them: “Well, are you at least having fun?”
Me: “SOMETIMES”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I eventually made it down in one piece, and we enjoyed some flatter skiing for a while. Then at some point, we found signs stating we were around a kilometer away, and this is when things got rough. The remaining portion of the trail grew steeper and steeper uphill almost continuously. While I wasn’t as inclined to fall when going uphill compared to downhill, I fell once in a while due to sheer exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.example.org/imgs/norway/0094.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;Enjoying a relaxing break&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Enjoying a relaxing break&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we made it to the top to Skjennungstua. We were on top of a mountain, and the views most certainly made that clear. This stop, which contained one of the many ski lodges dotting the park, is particularly known for good fresh cakes and other desserts, a fact we took full advantage of. As we sat outside on a table, sipping hot chocolate and nibbling first on bread with butter and brown cheese, then on cakes, we watched the two trails leading to the lodge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.example.org/imgs/norway/0095.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;Tyler looking down from the mountain&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

         alt=&#34;Our delicious snack, which included a brown cheese sandwich, a fruit crumble, and hot chocolate&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The outside of the lodge&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our trail was nearly abandoned producing just a couple skiers within the half hour. The other trail, however, was streaming in skiers of all ages and sizes, including kids who couldn’t have been older than 4. This was when we realized why everyone was surprised about our path to Skjennungstua: it worked, but there existed a path without the scarily steep downhill and exhaustingly steep uphill to follow; we just were too navigationally challenged to find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 4: Get to Ullevålseter
Given our top-of-the-mountain status, the next 2.2 km section was quite quick, though frighteningly downhill at parts. Within half an hour, we had made it to Ullevålseter. After our lengthy break at our last stop, we just stopped by the bathroom and moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 5: Get to Sognsvann
After seeing a sign indicating 6.5 km to Sognsvann, I was mentally prepared for the worst. However, this path was generally quite level; our greatest concern was trying to navigate the path among the surprisingly dense crowds. The only fall I suffered here was when I swerved to avoid a toddler, getting in the path of someone else much faster doing the same. He avoided me, but i freaked out and fell. Julien, who was unfortunately behind me, also suffered the same fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, we ended up making it to Sognsvann in just about an hour. Total, we had gone around 13 km and spent around 3.5 hours including the half hour break at Skjennungstua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sognsvann itself referred to large frozen lake next to our destination train station. We walked across its surface to an island in the middle where a family was having a campfire. After exploring, we headed to the station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.example.org/imgs/norway/0103.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;Julien on the frozen lake&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.example.org/imgs/norway/0101.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;Intricate ice crystals growing on the trees&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Intricate ice crystals growing on the trees&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 6: Maneuver the train transfer (and Step 7: Get off the train and Step 8: Return the skis and Step 9: Get home alive)
The Sognsvann stop was at the end of the 5 train line, and we needed to get to the end of the 1 train line, so we enjoyed a 20 minute ride back to the city and 30 minute ride back out to Tryvann. While this felt wonderful, standing up at the end was a struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning the skis was pretty uneventful, and soon we were on our way home. Shortly after, Allison and Magnus returned from Hemsedal, and we, along with Julien and Lukas, watched Trollhunter, a Norwegian mocumentary about a guy who hunts trolls. This was especially entertaining in the context of our last weekend Bergen trip as the movie visited similar places and the trolls resembled the ones which had terrified us in the forest.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Norway Part 1</title>
         <link>https://www.example.org/life-posts/norway-1/</link>
         <pubDate>Mon, 14 Jan 2019 16:45:05 -0500</pubDate>
         
         <guid>https://www.example.org/life-posts/norway-1/</guid>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;This IAP, I’m spending 4 weeks in Oslo, Norway doing software at the startup Cognite. I’ll be there with 2 other externs from MIT as well as 15-20 interns from the University of Waterloo who are here for 4 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1519&#34;&gt;1/5/19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I flew in this morning with a stopover in Iceland, then took a train into our apartment. The apartment has a huge common area, three bedrooms for the three of us, and a cute loft with an extra bed! I ran to 7-11 to pick up some stuff before coming back and falling asleep for a couple hours (red-eye international flights are usually restless). The next MIT extern, Allison, arrived at about this time, and we found a crepe place to eat at. This was somewhat of a struggle as food in Oslo is far more expensive than I expected. While cheap food exists, it’s definitely something we’ll have to search out. Accordingly, we stopped at a grocery store on the way back to pick up some essentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.example.org/imgs/norway/0001.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;First meal!&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;First meal!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;misc thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some doors have random buttons to open them. If you don’t realize this, you may believe you are locked in a narrow hallway which contains a bathroom, but is outside a restaurant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sliced bread is cool and all, but have you ever used a machine at a grocery store to slice your bread in front of you literally right before you buy it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1619&#34;&gt;1/6/19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a somewhat restless and jetlagged night, we went by in the morning to join the Canadian interns. We walked through the Vigeland Sculpture in Frogner Park and took lots of fun pics with all the sculptures and the landscape. Overall, the sculptures and such felt a bit underwhelming, but the snowy landscape and unfortunately early sunset made for good pictures at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.example.org/imgs/norway/0005-0007.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;The full group/mid jump&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The full group/mid jump&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.example.org/imgs/norway/0009.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;First meal!&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;First meal!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ventured out to find food, which was difficult given how many places close on Sunday, and eventually settled on something that felt vaguely like a Norwegian diner. Knowing Norway was not super vegetarian friendly, I came into this trip being okay with trying fish if need be. Today’s dinner turned out to be the first case of “need be” as the most vegetarian friendly option was salmon. While I was able to have a filling meal, it was very weird and definitely not something I am currently a fan of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;misc thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gustav Vigeland has a weird art style, and I kinda dig it, but was mildly disturbed. The monolith is very cool though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the MIT apartment has a wayyy bigger and nicer common area, so if anyone’s hosting a party, it’s def us
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;however, alc is nationalized and accordingly expensive and, so far, hard to find&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;also, waterloo interns are in a much more fun area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and there are way more of them together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and i think their setup is overall nicer, though I am grateful housing was found for me for the 4 weeks I am here&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;karaoke bars are surprisingly cheap here (~$6.30 per person per hour on sunday-thurs, double price fri-sat) given how expensive everything else is, might want to hit one up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1719&#34;&gt;1/7/19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s the first day of work! All in all, the actual day was pretty uneventful because it was mostly just presentations about what Cognite is and does as well as some presentations on what different teams here do. After we went back, the two other MIT externs went grocery shopping and I started figuring out the weekend’s trip logistics with Anna, a Waterloo intern. After figuring out an approximate (and unfortunately expensive) plan, we started cooking with our limited groceries from Sunday plus what Allison and Magnus brought back, but all we could do was bland, undersauced, whole wheat spaghetti. It was somewhat miserable, but it was at least something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before getting ready to sleep, Allison and I ranted to each other for a while about our annoyance with the food situation, which made me feel surprisingly better. We resolved to grocery shop better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Grocery store saga:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on saturday, we went to a small Kiwi grocery store and bought a few things, but the selection was pretty bad and stuff was expensive. on our way back, we found a grocery store that wasn’t on gmaps called Extra, and it looked huge, but we didn’t feel like carrying more, so we decided to come back tomorrow. allison referred to extra as “that target looking store”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on sunday, we went to extra, but since most stuff is closed on sunday, extra just had a tiny section open. unfortunately, we weren’t able to find anything we needed in this super limited selection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this morning, both allison and i realized we had dreamed about extra and its cornucopia of food just waiting. at least in my dream, it literally was target. unfortunately, when allison and magnus went today, they had inconsistent supply to the extent that they literally ran out of bread&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the next option to check out is the giant kiwi grocery store by work, which seemed best, but we’d have to carry what we bought on the long and crowded bus ride back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1819&#34;&gt;1/8/19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we started work with more presentations including some absolutely amazing demos. We followed this up with a workshop/hackathon which was the first opportunity to actually code during this internship. Afterwords, we played ping pong and had a catered mexican food dinner at work. Apparently, this company is intense enough at ping pong that they have an ELO ladder, so I definitely want to try making my mark. Dinner was awesome because it was in essentially unlimited quantities and pretty ok tasting. I ended up nabbing a catering tray with a mix of a bunch of stuff, so the next few dinners are now accounted for. We went grocery shopping anyways, and big Kiwi did not disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After coming back, we confirmed and booked plans for the first weekend: we’ll be going to Bergen (west of us) to see the most famous fjords of Norway. Given the two things I associated with Norway were fjords and northern lights, I’m glad I’ll be knocking one out this first weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;misc thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s basically dark both when we arrive at and leave work, which is mildly depressing. someone in the canadian intern apartment got a full spectrum lamp which apparently helps reset your circadian rhythm and prevent winter depression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;now that sustenance is roughly covered, time to figure out more weekday plans and alc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1919&#34;&gt;1/9/19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was the first day we joined our teams at work! I’ve finally got set-up with an external keyboard with a US keyboard layout instead of the Norwegian layout my laptop has. I went through some tutorial stuff and got some idea of what I’ll be working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that has been odd about Oslo is that we’ve hardly seen any real stores. Most stuff has been vaguely residential with the odd restaurant or grocery store here or there. Given the lack of Amazon use, I wondered how people got ordinary stuff. A full-timer had recommended a “general store” called Clas Ohlson we could visit, so we decided to go there today to get Allison a power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took the bus a couple stops past our normal one and ended up in a totally different looking part of town. There were tall buildings and shops and restaurants everywhere! When we eventually found our way to Clas Ohlson, it had just about everything, it’s basically their Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;misc thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the area by clas ohlson seemed a lot more fun and lively than the more residential area by where we live, we may want to come back to there for food/bars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;11019&#34;&gt;1/10/19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our orientation, Maria (someone involved with organizing our internship) mentioned we could get certain group social events with coworkers covered, so we asked about karaoke. After getting her confirmation, we booked a room for tomorrow night! Every lit karaoke trip requires an equally lit pregame, so I looked up how buying alcohol here works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APPARENTLY, like many things in Norway, alcohol is nationalized. Anything above 4.7% ABV is sold in state stores called Vinmonopolet (“wine monopoly”) where everything has a huge state tax on it and closes really early. Here, people will actually buy as much as they can from duty free because it’s that much cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After work, I rushed to a Vinmonopolet and got there at 5:58pm, 2 minutes before closing. I bought their cheapest vodka and cheapest boxed wine, which both ended up being almost exactly the same volume * abv / price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing tomorrow will be busy, I prepped some food for Bergen. In particular, I created an entity I shall thus refer to as the sandwich loaf: an entire loaf of vaguely round bread converted into a series of peanut butter and nutella sandwiches. The sandwich loaf is compact, non-perishable, somewhat ok tasting, and calorically magnificent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;misc thoughts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the sun sets during working hours during norway winters, and it is fabulous when it does - the office has pretty big windows, so it’s pretty easy to catch this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;11119&#34;&gt;1/11/19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After work, a few interns congregated at our place for a short pregame before we headed to SYNG MER for our 6:45-8:45 booking. While the room was a bit cozy (cramped) for the 12 of us, the actual karaoke setup was awesome. Like the nicer places in NYC, SYNG MER had an electronic song selection and queue, but unlike anywhere else I’ve seen, they also had options to adjust the key and tempo of each song!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After karaoke, we stopped by a burger place called Max, which had some of the cheapest food we’ve seen so far, before heading back to our place to eat and hang out with everyone. At the end of our first successful apartment party, we slept relatively early in anticipation of Bergen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t sure whether to include this next part for today or tomorrow, but at 7:30 am, we got woken up by a very unfortunate fire alarm. We were only outside for a few minutes, but it was quite sad to be woken up early on the only day we can sleep in&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;misc thoughts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the karaoke place has a weird art piece in the window of a baby with a mic. i dig the aesthetic&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;11219&#34;&gt;1/12/19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started our trip with a 7 hour trip from Oslo to Bergen on the Bergen Railway. We were specifically told to do this during daylight for the wonderful views, and they did not disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.example.org/imgs/norway/0018.jpg&#34;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we arrived in Bergen, and Bergen is beautiful. Even though it was dark and rainy, the shiny cobblestone streets were super pretty. In addition, part of the city is built up onto a mountain, and the lights of all the houses outline the shape of the mountain in the night. The diagonal string of lights in the upper left of that picture go along the Floibanen, a steeply inclined (26 degree incline) railway which people can use to travel along the mountain (we’ll come back to this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.example.org/imgs/norway/0023.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;Bergen&amp;amp;rsquo;s city lights&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bergen&amp;rsquo;s city lights&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we went to our Airbnb to drop off our stuff. The apartment was super cute with super aesthetic lamps and the roundest fridge we’ve ever seen. Our host was also super nice (he lived upstairs) and he recommended we check out the Floibanen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The train car itself was actually built shaped like a staircase to allow for people to sit on horizontal surfaces despite the steep incline. Also, once it started moving, the train movement felt more like a rollercoaster than a normal train. I had originally thought this was mainly a touristy thing used to take tourists to the lookout at the top, but the train actually stopped at intermediate points up the mountain to allow people to get out and go to where they lived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/dn1CHxUNvQ8&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top, we took some cute pictures at a lookout before wandering around to kill the half hour we had until our trip back down. We came across a giant troll costume, and in the dense fog, it was legitimately scary. The presence of a playground and elementary school behind the statue certainly contributed. Interestingly, the use of flash generally made our pictures turn out worse because of how reflective the fog was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.example.org/imgs/norway/0027.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;Looking out over the city&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.example.org/imgs/norway/0030.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;A foggy and obviously haunted playground&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A foggy and obviously haunted playground&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we continued to wander around, we found a signpost pointing out a couple trails and destinations. Most suspiciously, it had a sign which pointed to “THE LAKE” which appeared to be handwritten and was a different color than the others. For no good reason, we followed it into some of the darkest, foggiest, most ethereal woods I’ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.example.org/imgs/norway/0031.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;A foreboding entrance - note the sign for &amp;amp;ldquo;THE LAKE&amp;amp;rdquo;&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A foreboding entrance - note the sign for &amp;ldquo;THE LAKE&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we walked through the trees with inconsistent lamp posts, we came across assorted signs. The first said “PLEASE DON’T WAKE THE BABY DINOSAURS”. With the original troll statue being next to a playground, this playful sign felt slightly more sinister. The only picture I got is incredibly hard to read as the sign was far from a lamp post and flash was blocked by the increasingly dense fog. The second sign we came across was in Norwegian, so Magnus used Google Translate to see what it said. What we got was something like “Don’t sit here when all hope is gone”. Needless to say, none of us sat in the bench immediately in front of the sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.example.org/imgs/norway/0032_.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;The two signs we came across - it was impossible to get a better picture of the first sign because it was too far from any of the streetlamps, and flash reflected off the fog as shown&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we made it to “THE LAKE”. There wasn’t really a lamp post nearby, so the only present illumination was what appeared to be a floating green light somewhere further down along the shore. With how dense the fog was, my picture with flash was useless, and without flash, I had to use a half second exposure just to see anything. After documenting the scene, we rushed all the way back and onto the train car just in time to head back down.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being traumatized by the most surreal and horror movie-esque experience of my thus short life, we walked back through some wholesome cobblestone streets on our way back home. We ended the night by watching Blink (a famously scary Doctor Who episode) and cooking some tortellini to take with us tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;misc thoughts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i’d always felt horror movies were super unrealistic because people are always using their phone cameras to document stuff on social media. here though, i literally just couldn’t take a quality picture, and this fact was deeply disturbing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we asked lukas (started at Cognite w/ us, he’s actually norwegian tho, so he’s our token local) what the scary sign (“Don’t sit here when all hope is gone”) translated to, and he said “Don’t sit inside when all hope is outside”, which is significantly more positive, but of course we’re going to take the negative interpretation when we’re in that cursed place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;11319&#34;&gt;1/13/19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today started with 1.5 hours back on our initial train towards Oslo, but we got off at somewhere called Voss. Here, we caught a bus, which officially started our self-guided Norway in a Nutshell tour. This bus ride started us going through a relatively wide, “U-shaped” valley with pristine winter landscapes, distant mountains, and wonderfully yellow and red houses. At some point, we passed through a long stone tunnel and emerged into a much more narry, “V-shaped” valley lined with 4000 foot tall mountains. Our driver informed us that this site had achieved UNESCO World Heritage status, like many of the places we would visit today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.example.org/imgs/norway/0034.jpg&#34;

            &lt;p&gt;A dark forest&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus ride ended at Gudvangen, a 60 person town which a million tourists pass through every year. Thankfully, we came at the height of the off-season so the town was relatively empty. Gudvangen is at one end of the famous Nærøyfjord. Fjords in general are roughly tree shaped, and the large fjord we’re in is Sognefjord. Nærøyfjord specifically refers to the section of it which includes a branching point and the two branches which end at the towns Gudvangen and Flam. Our boat tour would take us from one to the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.example.org/imgs/norway/0039.jpg&#34;/&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gudvangen itself was incredibly gorgeous with the end of the fjord enclosed in mountains. The water itself was bright green, crystal clear, and filled with red and orange starfish. After enjoying a pastry at a cafe here, we started our ferry ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.example.org/imgs/norway/0040.jpg&#34;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ferry ride was without a doubt, the most beautiful ride in any vehicle I have taken in my entire life. The boat was at around 10% capacity, so we had no trouble getting unobstructed views from any part. While it was extremely cold and windy, we spent as much time as possible on the outdoor deck instead of the heated inside area, but we definitely had to take occasional breaks to defrost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended the ferry in Flam. We stopped first to buy pastries at a cafe there, and these were some of the largest and best pastries I’ve ever had. I personally got a piece of brioche, but the others’ cinnamon bun and chocolate croissant were both amazing too. We then went to a random shop and I found the most Norwegian sweater I’ve ever seen. It was unfortunately a bit more than I was willing to spend, but I’m just glad I was able to experience its existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next part of our journey was a ride on the Flam railway, one of the most famously picturesque railways in Europe. This track maintains about a 6 degree elevation angle through its 1 hour journey to Myrdal, another stop on the Oslo -&amp;gt; Bergen railway. The train wove through the mountains around Flam and the fjord and gave us plenty more fantastic views. The train itself also had a very old-fashioned look on the inside which definitely contributed to the ambiance. We stopped next to a frozen waterfall for pictures, and the four of us threw snowballs at it. There was also a troll statue here, which made us feel unfortunately triggered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Myrdal, we caught a train which took us to Bergen, then we flew back to Oslo and slept very soon after we got home.&lt;/p&gt;
